# Documentation Change Log

Quick access to recently updated documentation. Changes listed in reverse chronological order (newest first).

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-10

#### Technical Architecture Guide - Terminology Consolidation (UPDATED)
**Link**: [Architecture Guide](/docs/architecture)

**Summary**: Consolidated terminology throughout architecture guide for consistency:
- **Pattern** = abstract concept (KeyValue, PubSub, Outbox, Claim Check, etc.)
- **Pattern Provider** = runtime component implementing patterns (Kafka provider, PostgreSQL provider, etc.)
- Updated all diagrams and references from "plugin" → "pattern provider"
- Clarified organizational scalability benefits of client-originated configuration
- Added authorization boundaries section explaining expressibility vs security/reliability tension

**Impact**: Consistent terminology makes architecture clearer. "Pattern" emphasizes conceptual abstraction; "Pattern Provider" emphasizes runtime implementation.

---

#### ADR-002: Client-Originated Configuration - Authorization Boundaries (EXPANDED)
**Link**: [ADR-002](/adr/adr-002)

**Summary**: Major expansion adding organizational scalability and configuration authorization section:
- Organizational scalability challenge: Infrastructure team size stays constant (10 people supports 500+ teams)
- Authorization boundaries: Three permission levels (Guided, Advanced, Expert)
- Policy enforcement mechanism with Rust validation code examples
- Permission escalation workflow with audit trail
- Common configuration mistakes prevented (excessive retention, wrong backend for pattern, over-provisioning)
- Organizational benefits: 50x improvement (platform team of 10 supports 500+ teams vs 1 DBA per 10 teams)
- Future enhancements: Automated permission elevation, cost budgeting integration

**Key Innovation**: Client configurability essential for organizational scalability, but requires policy-driven authorization boundaries. Three-tier permission model balances expressibility (teams move fast) with security/reliability (prevent misconfigurations).

**Impact**: Documents critical tension between self-service empowerment and platform stability. Provides concrete policy enforcement mechanism for production deployments.

---

#### Technical Architecture Guide (NEW)
**Link**: [Architecture Guide](/docs/architecture)

**Summary**: Comprehensive technical architecture overview document with system diagrams and backend interface mapping:
- High-level architecture overview with three-layer design philosophy (Client API → Pattern Composition → Backend Execution)
- Complete system architecture diagram showing data flow from clients → proxy → patterns → plugins → backends
- Proxy and plugin architecture diagram with responsibility separation
- Backend interface decomposition catalog (45 thin interfaces across 10 data models)
- Backend implementation matrix showing which backends implement which interfaces
- Pattern composition and slot-based configuration examples
- Design rationale covering key architectural decisions
- Quick reference guides for backend and pattern selection

**Key Innovation**: Single comprehensive guide orienting technical users to Prism's architecture, component responsibilities, and backend interface mapping strategy. Combines high-level system design with detailed interface catalogs and practical quick reference guides.

**Impact**: Provides authoritative technical reference for platform engineers, backend developers, and architects evaluating or working with Prism. Complements existing RFCs and ADRs with cohesive architectural overview.

#### MEMO-006: Backend Interface Decomposition and Schema Registry (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-006](/memos/MEMO-006-backend-interface-decomposition-schema-registry)

**Summary**: Comprehensive architectural guide for decomposing backends into thin, composable proto service interfaces and establishing schema registry for patterns and slots:
- **Design Decision**: Use explicit interface flavors (not capability flags) for type safety
- 45 thin interfaces across 10 data models (KeyValue, PubSub, Stream, Queue, List, Set, SortedSet, TimeSeries, Graph, Document)
- Each data model has multiple interfaces: Basic (required), Scan, TTL, Transactional, Batch, etc.
- Backend implementation matrix showing interface composition (Redis: 16 interfaces, Postgres: 16 different mix, MemStore: 2 minimal)
- Pattern schemas with slots requiring specific interface combinations
- Schema registry filesystem layout (registry/interfaces/, registry/backends/, registry/patterns/)
- Configuration generator workflow with validation
- Examples: Redis implements keyvalue_basic + keyvalue_scan + keyvalue_ttl + keyvalue_transactional + keyvalue_batch
- Capabilities expressed through interface presence (TTL support = implements keyvalue_ttl interface)

**Key Innovation**: Thin interfaces enable type-safe backend composition. Pattern slots specify required interfaces (e.g., Multicast Registry needs keyvalue_basic + keyvalue_scan for registry slot). No runtime capability checks - compiler enforces contracts.

**Impact**: Enables straightforward config generation, backend substitutability, and clear contracts for what each backend supports. Foundation for schema-driven pattern composition.

#### MEMO-005: Client Protocol Design Philosophy - Composition vs Use-Case Specificity (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-005](/memos/MEMO-005-client-protocol-design-philosophy)

**Summary**: Comprehensive memo resolving the architectural tension between composable primitives (RFC-014) and use-case-specific protocols (RFC-017), covering:
- Context comparison: RFC-014 composable primitives vs RFC-017 use-case patterns
- Four design principles (push complexity down, developer comprehension, schema evolution, keep proxy small)
- Proposed layered API architecture: Layer 1 (generic primitives) + Layer 2 (use-case patterns)
- Pattern coordinators as plugins (not core proxy) for independent evolution
- Configuration examples showing per-namespace choice of primitives vs patterns
- Decision matrix comparing primitives-only, patterns-only, and layered approaches
- Implementation roadmap aligned with RFC-018 POCs
- Success metrics for developer experience, system complexity, and pattern adoption

**Key Innovation**: Applications choose per-namespace between Layer 1 (generic KeyValue, PubSub) for maximum control or Layer 2 (ergonomic Multicast Registry, Saga) for rapid development. Pattern coordinators are optional plugins that compose Layer 1 primitives, keeping core proxy small (~10k LOC) while providing self-documenting APIs for common use cases.

**Impact**: Resolves "composition vs use-case" design question with both layers, addressing developer simplicity (Layer 2), proxy size (plugins), and flexibility (Layer 1).

---

#### MEMO-003: Documentation-First Development Approach (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-003](/memos/MEMO-003-documentation-first-development)

**Summary**: Comprehensive memo defining the documentation-first development approach used in Prism, covering:
- Definition and core principles (Design in Documentation → Review → Implement → Validate)
- Notable improvements over code-first workflows with concrete examples
- Expected outcomes (faster reviews, better designs, reduced rework)
- Strategies for success (blocking requirements, design tool, living documentation)
- Validation and quality assurance (tooling/validate_docs.py)
- Metrics and success criteria (documentation coverage, build success rate, review velocity)
- Proposed improvements (code example validation, decision graph visualization, RFC-driven task generation)

**Impact**: Establishes documentation-first as the core development methodology, with validation tooling as a blocking requirement before commits.
