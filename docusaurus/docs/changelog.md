## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-15

#### ADR-057: Refactor pattern-launcher to prism-launcher as General Control Plane Launcher (NEW)
**Link**: [ADR-057](/adr/adr-057)

**Summary**: Architectural refactoring from pattern-specific launcher to general-purpose prism-launcher capable of managing all Prism components:

**Refactoring Rationale**:
- **Current Limitation**: pattern-launcher only manages pattern processes
- **Emerging Needs**: Launch proxies, backends, utilities dynamically via admin
- **Control Plane Evolution**: Unified launcher for all component types (not just patterns)
- **prismctl local**: Single launcher manages entire local stack

**Core Changes**:
- **Binary Rename**: `pattern-launcher` → `prism-launcher`
- **Process Abstraction**: `Pattern` → `ManagedProcess` with type field (pattern, proxy, backend, utility)
- **Unified Protocol**: Extended ControlPlane service handles all process types
- **Capability-Based**: Launchers advertise supported process types in registration

**Process Type Support**:
```go
type ProcessType string

const (
    ProcessTypePattern  ProcessType = "pattern"   // keyvalue-runner, pubsub-runner
    ProcessTypeProxy    ProcessType = "proxy"     // prism-proxy instances
    ProcessTypeBackend  ProcessType = "backend"   // redis-driver, kafka-driver
    ProcessTypeUtility  ProcessType = "utility"   // log-collector, metrics-exporter
)
```

**Generalized Control Plane**:
```protobuf
message LauncherRegistration {
  string launcher_id = 1;
  repeated string capabilities = 2;  // ["pattern", "proxy", "backend"]
  int32 max_processes = 3;           // Renamed from max_patterns
  repeated string process_types = 4; // Supported types
}

message ProcessAssignment {
  string process_id = 1;
  string process_type = 2;           // Discriminator
  ProcessConfig config = 3;
}

message ProcessConfig {
  // Common fields
  string binary = 1;
  repeated string args = 2;

  // Type-specific configs
  PatternConfig pattern = 10;
  ProxyConfig proxy = 11;
  BackendConfig backend = 12;
  UtilityConfig utility = 13;
}
```

**Implementation Phases** (4 weeks):
- **Phase 1**: Rename binary, introduce ProcessType enum, rename Process → ManagedProcess
- **Phase 2**: Generalize control plane protocol (update ADR-056 protobuf messages)
- **Phase 3**: Minimal process manager changes (type-specific validation)
- **Phase 4**: Update prismctl local to use single prism-launcher
- **Phase 5**: Admin-side process provisioner with capability-based launcher selection
- **Phase 6**: Documentation updates (RFC-035, MEMO-034, migration guide)

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Keep `pattern-launcher` symlink for 1-2 releases
- Default ProcessType to "pattern" if not specified
- Admin recognizes both old PatternAssignment and new ProcessAssignment
- Existing pattern-launcher configs continue working

**prismctl Local Simplification**:
```go
components := []struct { name, binary, args }{{
    name:   "prism-admin",
    binary: "prism-admin",
    args:   []string{"serve", "--port=8980"},
}, {
    name:   "prism-launcher",
    binary: "prism-launcher",
    args:   []string{
        "--admin-endpoint=localhost:8980",
        "--launcher-id=launcher-01",
        "--max-processes=50",
        "--capabilities=pattern,proxy,backend",
    },
}}
// After launcher starts, admin dynamically provisions:
// - 2 proxy instances, keyvalue pattern, any other components
```

**Key Innovation**: Single launcher binary manages all Prism components (not just patterns). Process type abstraction with type-discriminated configs. Capability-based launcher registration (not all launchers support all types). Unified control plane protocol for all process types. pkg/procmgr stays mostly unchanged (already general-purpose). Enables mixed workloads (patterns + proxies + backends on same launcher).

**Impact**: Simplifies deployment (one launcher vs multiple). prismctl local uses single launcher for entire stack. Admin can dynamically provision proxy instances (horizontal scaling). Backend drivers can run as managed processes. Unified operational visibility (all processes in admin UI). Flexible workload distribution (admin selects launcher by capability). Foundation for sophisticated orchestration (admin coordinates all component types). Completes control plane architecture: unified launcher manages all Prism components under admin coordination.

#### ADR-056: Launcher-Admin Control Plane Protocol (NEW)
**Link**: [ADR-056](/adr/adr-056)

**Summary**: Extension of control plane protocol (ADR-055) to support pattern-launcher registration and dynamic pattern provisioning via prism-admin:

**Core Protocol Extensions**:
- **Launcher Registration**: Launcher connects with `--admin-endpoint`, sends LauncherRegistration with ID, capacity, capabilities
- **Pattern Assignment**: Admin pushes PatternAssignment messages with pattern configs and backend slots
- **Pattern Provisioning**: Client → Admin → Launcher flow for dynamic pattern deployment
- **Pattern Health Heartbeat**: 30s interval with pattern status, PID, memory, restart count, error count
- **Pattern Deprovisioning**: Admin sends RevokePattern with graceful timeout (default 30s)

**Extended ControlPlane Service**:
```protobuf
service ControlPlane {
  // ... proxy RPCs from ADR-055 ...
  rpc RegisterLauncher(LauncherRegistration) returns (LauncherRegistrationAck);
  rpc AssignPattern(PatternAssignment) returns (PatternAssignmentAck);
  rpc LauncherHeartbeat(LauncherHeartbeat) returns (HeartbeatAck);
  rpc RevokePattern(PatternRevocation) returns (PatternRevocationAck);
}
```

**Pattern Assignment Details**:
- **Pattern Metadata**: Pattern ID, type (keyvalue, pubsub, multicast_registry), namespace
- **Isolation Configuration**: Isolation level (none, namespace, session) per pattern
- **Backend Slot Configuration**: Backend configs for each pattern slot
- **Version Tracking**: Config version for idempotency and rollback

**Launcher Capacity Management**:
- **Max Patterns**: Configurable per launcher (default 10-20 patterns)
- **Load Balancing**: Admin distributes patterns based on launcher capacity
- **Resource Tracking**: Memory usage, CPU%, pattern count reported in heartbeat
- **Graceful Degradation**: Launcher operates with local patterns directory if admin unavailable

**Storage Schema Extensions** (ADR-054):
```sql
CREATE TABLE launchers (
  launcher_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  max_patterns INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('healthy', 'unhealthy', 'unknown')),
  last_seen TIMESTAMP
);

ALTER TABLE patterns ADD COLUMN launcher_id TEXT;
```

**Implementation Components**:
- **Launcher-Side**: Go `LauncherAdminClient` in `pkg/launcher/admin_client.go` with registration, heartbeat, pattern provisioning
- **Admin-Side**: Go `ControlPlaneService` extensions in `cmd/prism-admin/launcher_control.go` with launcher registry and pattern assignment
- **Process Manager Integration**: Heartbeat collects pattern health from `procmgr.ProcessManager`

**Launcher Configuration**:
```yaml
admin:
  endpoint: "admin.prism.local:8981"
  launcher_id: "launcher-01"
  region: "us-west-2"
  max_patterns: 20
  heartbeat_interval: "30s"
```

**prismctl Local Integration**:
- Updated `prismctl local start` to launch pattern-launcher with `--admin-endpoint=localhost:8980`
- Launcher registers with admin on startup
- Admin tracks all running patterns across launcher instances
- Full local stack: admin + launcher + proxy with control plane integration

**Key Innovation**: Unified control plane service handles both proxy registration (ADR-055) and launcher registration. Single gRPC connection from launcher to admin. Dynamic pattern provisioning without launcher restarts. Admin has complete view of patterns across all launchers. Graceful pattern deprovisioning with 30s timeout. Pattern health monitoring via heartbeat (status, PID, memory, restarts, errors).

**Impact**: Eliminates manual pattern deployment. Admin coordinates pattern distribution across launchers. Dynamic pattern provisioning enables zero-downtime pattern updates. Health monitoring provides operational visibility. Horizontal scaling by adding launchers. Foundation for multi-launcher deployments. Completes control plane architecture: clients → proxies → launchers → backends, all coordinated by admin. Enables `prismctl local` to orchestrate full stack with centralized control.

---

#### ADR-055: Proxy-Admin Control Plane Protocol (NEW)
**Link**: [ADR-055](/adr/adr-055)

**Summary**: Complete bidirectional gRPC control plane protocol between prism-proxy and prism-admin enabling centralized namespace management and partition-based distribution:

**Core Protocol Flows**:
- **Proxy Registration**: Proxy connects on startup with `--admin-endpoint`, sends ProxyRegistration with ID, address, region, capabilities
- **Namespace Assignment**: Admin pushes NamespaceAssignment messages with configs and partition IDs to proxies
- **Client Namespace Creation**: Client → Proxy → Admin → Proxy flow for namespace creation requests
- **Health & Heartbeat**: 30s interval heartbeats with namespace health stats (active sessions, RPS, status)
- **Namespace Revocation**: Admin can revoke namespace assignments from proxies

**Partition Distribution System**:
- **256 Partitions**: CRC32 hash of namespace name → partition ID (0-255)
- **Consistent Hashing**: Partition → proxy mapping survives proxy additions/removals
- **Round-Robin Distribution**: Proxy-01: partitions [0-63], Proxy-02: [64-127], Proxy-03: [128-191], Proxy-04: [192-255]
- **Namespace Isolation**: Each namespace maps to one proxy per partition
- **Rebalancing**: Admin redistributes partitions when proxies join/leave

**Protobuf Service Definition**:
```protobuf
service ControlPlane {
  rpc RegisterProxy(ProxyRegistration) returns (ProxyRegistrationAck);
  rpc AssignNamespace(NamespaceAssignment) returns (NamespaceAssignmentAck);
  rpc CreateNamespace(CreateNamespaceRequest) returns (CreateNamespaceResponse);
  rpc Heartbeat(ProxyHeartbeat) returns (HeartbeatAck);
  rpc RevokeNamespace(NamespaceRevocation) returns (NamespaceRevocationAck);
}
```

**Implementation Sketches**:
- **Proxy-Side**: Rust `AdminClient` in `prism-proxy/src/admin_client.rs` with registration, heartbeat loop, namespace creation
- **Admin-Side**: Go `ControlPlaneService` in `cmd/prism-admin/control_plane.go` with proxy registry and namespace distribution
- **Partition Manager**: Go `PartitionManager` for consistent hashing with CRC32, range assignment, and proxy lookup

**Proxy Configuration**:
```yaml
admin:
  endpoint: "admin.prism.local:8981"
  proxy_id: "proxy-01"
  region: "us-west-2"
  heartbeat_interval: "30s"
  reconnect_backoff: "5s"
```

**Graceful Fallback**:
- Proxy attempts admin connection on startup
- If admin unavailable: falls back to local config file mode
- Proxy operates independently with local namespaces
- Data plane continues regardless of admin connectivity

**Key Innovation**: Bidirectional gRPC protocol enables centralized namespace management while maintaining proxy independence. Partition-based consistent hashing provides predictable routing and easy rebalancing. Heartbeat mechanism gives admin complete visibility into proxy/namespace health. Client-initiated namespace creation flows through admin for coordination. Graceful fallback ensures proxy continues operating if admin unavailable.

**Impact**: Eliminates manual namespace distribution across proxies. Admin has complete view of all proxies and namespaces. Dynamic configuration without proxy restarts. Horizontal scaling by adding proxies (admin redistributes partitions automatically). Operational metrics via heartbeat. Foundation for multi-proxy deployments with centralized control. Addresses namespace creation flow, partition routing, and proxy registry requirements. Enables prismctl local command to orchestrate admin + launcher + proxy with full control plane integration.

#### ADR-054: SQLite Storage for prism-admin Local State (PLANNED)
**Link**: ADR-054 (planned)

**Summary**: Complete SQLite-based local storage implementation for prism-admin providing operational state persistence:

**Core Implementation**:
- **Default Storage**: SQLite embedded database at `~/.prism/admin.db` (zero configuration)
- **Database URN Support**: `-db` flag for custom locations (sqlite://, postgresql://)
- **Schema Design**: 4 tables (namespaces, proxies, patterns, audit_logs) with indexes
- **SQL Migrations**: golang-migrate with embedded FS for automatic schema upgrades
- **Pure Go Driver**: modernc.org/sqlite (no CGO, cross-platform builds)

**Database Schema**:
- **Namespaces**: Name, description, metadata (JSON), timestamps
- **Proxies**: ProxyID, address, version, status (healthy/unhealthy), last_seen, metadata
- **Patterns**: PatternID, type, proxy mapping, namespace, status, config (JSON)
- **Audit Logs**: Complete API interaction history (timestamp, user, action, method, path, status, request/response bodies, duration, client IP)

**Storage Operations**:
- **Namespaces**: CreateNamespace, GetNamespace, ListNamespaces
- **Proxies**: UpsertProxy (tracks last known state), GetProxy, ListProxies
- **Patterns**: CreatePattern, ListPatternsByNamespace
- **Audit Logs**: LogAudit, QueryAuditLogs (with filtering by namespace, user, time range)

**CLI Integration**:
- **Default Usage**: `prism-admin server` (auto-creates ~/.prism/admin.db)
- **Custom SQLite**: `prism-admin server -db sqlite:///path/to/admin.db`
- **PostgreSQL**: `prism-admin server -db postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/prism_admin`
- **Config Integration**: Viper binding for storage.db configuration

**Testing**:
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 5 test categories with 17 total tests
- **Storage Initialization**: Database creation, migration application, schema validation
- **CRUD Operations**: Namespace, proxy, pattern creation and retrieval
- **Audit Logging**: Query filtering, time ranges, pagination
- **URN Parsing**: Multiple database types (sqlite relative/absolute, postgresql, error cases)
- **All Tests Pass**: 100% pass rate in 0.479s

**Performance Features**:
- **SQLite Optimizations**: WAL mode, NORMAL synchronous, foreign keys enabled, 5s busy timeout
- **Concurrent Access**: Read-heavy workload optimized (admin operations infrequent)
- **JSON Flexibility**: Metadata columns store flexible JSON without schema migrations
- **Index Coverage**: Common query paths indexed (timestamps, namespaces, resources, status)

**Migration Strategy**:
- **Embedded Migrations**: SQL files compiled into binary via embed.FS
- **Automatic Application**: Migrations run on startup using golang-migrate/migrate
- **Version Tracking**: schema_version table records applied migrations
- **Rollback Support**: .down.sql files enable migration rollback

**Key Innovation**: Zero-config SQLite default enables immediate local usage while supporting external PostgreSQL for production multi-instance deployments. Complete audit trail of all API interactions provides compliance foundation. Pure Go implementation eliminates CGO cross-compilation issues. JSON columns provide schema flexibility without migration overhead.

**Impact**: Prism-admin now has persistent state for troubleshooting, auditing, and historical analysis. Administrators can view proxy/pattern states even when services are offline. Audit logs provide complete compliance trail for security reviews. SQLite default eliminates external dependencies for local development. PostgreSQL support enables production deployments with HA requirements. Foundation for prism-admin web UI (RFC-036) with persistent storage backend. Addresses operational visibility gap where transient state was lost between prism-admin invocations.

#### RFC-036: Minimalist Web Framework for Prism Admin UI with templ+htmx+Gin (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-036](/rfc/rfc-036)

**Summary**: Comprehensive RFC proposing **templ + htmx + Gin** as an alternative to ADR-028's FastAPI + gRPC-Web + Vanilla JavaScript stack for the Prism Admin UI:

**Core Proposal**:
- **Language Consolidation**: Replace Python admin UI backend with Go (matches prismctl, plugins, and proxy ecosystem)
- **Technology Stack**: templ (type-safe HTML templates), htmx (HTML over the wire), Gin (HTTP framework)
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Progressive enhancement with HTML fragments (no JavaScript build step)
- **Direct gRPC Access**: Native gRPC calls to Admin API (no gRPC-Web translation overhead)

**Comparison with ADR-028**:
- **Container Size**: 15-20MB (templ+htmx) vs 100-150MB (FastAPI) - 85-87% smaller
- **Startup Time**: &lt;50ms vs 1-2 seconds - 20-40x faster
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation (templ) vs runtime validation (Python)
- **Language Consistency**: Go only vs Python + JavaScript
- **Memory Usage**: 20-30MB vs 50-100MB - 50-60% reduction

**Key Features**:
- **templ Templates**: Compile-time type-safe HTML with IDE autocomplete and XSS protection
- **htmx Patterns**: Declarative AJAX (no JavaScript required) with 5 common patterns documented
- **OIDC Integration**: Reuses prismctl authentication infrastructure (RFC-010)
- **Project Structure**: Clean separation of handlers, templates, middleware, and static assets
- **Appendix Guide**: Complete implementation reference with patterns, gotchas, and best practices

**Security**:
- Automatic XSS escaping in templ (explicit `templ.Raw()` opt-in for trusted HTML)
- CSRF protection via Gin middleware
- OIDC session cookie validation

**Migration Path**:
- Phase 1-2: Parallel deployment (weeks 1-2), Feature parity (weeks 3-4)
- Phase 3-4: Switch default and sunset FastAPI (weeks 5-8)
- Optional: Embed admin UI in proxy binary (future optimization)

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests: Template rendering with context validation
- Integration tests: Full CRUD workflows with mock Admin API
- Browser tests: End-to-end with chromedp (optional)

**Key Innovation**: Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement eliminates JavaScript framework complexity while maintaining modern UX. templ provides React-like component model but server-side with compile-time safety. htmx enables rich interactions (live search, optimistic updates, confirmations) without writing JavaScript. Language consolidation reduces maintenance burden and aligns admin UI with Go ecosystem.

**Impact**: Addresses ADR-028 complexity by eliminating Python dependency and reducing deployment footprint by 85%+. Go developers can contribute to both CLI and UI without learning Python. Faster startup enables better local development experience. Type-safe templates prevent entire class of XSS vulnerabilities. Foundation for maintainable admin UI that scales with project complexity. Demonstrates practical alternative to SPA frameworks for CRUD-focused applications.

**Documentation Quality**: RFC includes comprehensive appendix with 5 htmx patterns, attribute reference, best practices, and common gotchas. Provides copy-paste examples for namespace CRUD operations. References existing ADRs (028, 040) and RFCs (003, 010) for context.

  - `IsolationManager` interface with per-level implementations
  - Process key generation: `shared:{pattern}`, `ns:{namespace}:{pattern}`, `session:{namespace}:{sessionId}:{pattern}`
  - Concurrent-safe process lookup with sync.RWMutex
  - Memory isolation: Each manager maintains independent process registry
- **Work Queue with Backoff** (`pkg/procmgr/work_queue.go`): Exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s) with 20% jitter
  - Buffered channel (100 items) with async job submission
  - Consumer goroutine with configurable workers
  - Graceful shutdown with in-flight job completion
- **Process Manager** (`pkg/procmgr/process_manager.go`): Kubernetes-inspired state machine (6 states)
  - States: Pending → Starting → Running → Terminating → Failed → Completed
  - Automatic restart on crashes (exponential backoff)
  - Circuit breaker: 5 consecutive failures → terminal state
  - Health check monitoring with configurable intervals
- **Production Error Handling**: Comprehensive recovery and cleanup systems

### 2025-10-14

#### RFC-033: Claim Check Pattern + ADRs for Object Storage Testing (NEW)
**Links**: [RFC-033](/rfc/rfc-033), [ADR-051](/adr/adr-051), [ADR-052](/adr/adr-052), [ADR-053](/adr/adr-053), [Test Framework Updates](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/tree/main/tests/acceptance/framework)

**Summary**: Comprehensive design documentation for claim check pattern enabling large payload handling via object storage with namespace coordination:

**RFC-033 Claim Check Pattern**:
- Enterprise Integration Pattern for handling payloads >1MB threshold
- Producer uploads large payloads to object storage, sends claim reference through message broker
- Consumer retrieves payload using claim check from object storage
- Namespace-level coordination: Producers/consumers share claim check configuration
- ClaimCheckMessage protobuf with claim_id, bucket, object_key, checksum, compression info
- Proxy validates producer/consumer claim check configs match
- Configuration: threshold (1MB default), backend (minio/s3/gcs), bucket, TTL, compression
- Producer flow: Check size → compress → upload → set TTL → send claim
- Consumer flow: Receive claim → download → verify checksum → decompress → process
- ObjectStoreInterface definition for claim check operations
- Acceptance test scenarios: LargePayload (5MB), ThresholdBoundary, Compression, TTL, ChecksumValidation

**ADR-051 MinIO Testing Infrastructure**:
- Decision: Use MinIO for local claim check testing (not LocalStack, Azurite, S3Mock)
- Rationale: Full S3 compatibility, lightweight (50MB), fast startup (2s), complete TTL/lifecycle support
- testcontainers setup pattern with MinIO container lifecycle management
- Test bucket isolation strategy: `{suite}-{backend}-{timestamp}` naming
- Lifecycle policy setup for automatic claim expiration
- Implementation plan: MinIO driver (Week 1), test framework integration (Week 1), claim check tests (Week 2)
- Migration path to production S3/GCS/Azure
- Test setup pattern with cleanup and health checks

**ADR-052 Object Store Interface**:
- Core ObjectStoreInterface definition for claim check operations
- 11 methods: Put, PutStream, Get, GetStream, Delete, Exists, GetMetadata, SetTTL, CreateBucket, DeleteBucket, BucketExists
- Design principles: minimal surface area, streaming support, idempotent deletes, metadata separation, TTL abstraction
- ObjectMetadata struct for metadata-only operations
- MinIO driver implementation examples with error translation
- Streaming thresholds: Use PutStream for payloads >10MB
- Error handling with standard types (ErrObjectNotFound, ErrBucketNotFound, ErrAccessDenied)
- Testing strategy with contract tests for all backends (MinIO, S3, GCS, Mock)
- Performance considerations: connection pooling, retry strategy, metadata caching
- Implementation phases: Interface definition (1 day), MinIO driver (3 days), S3 driver (3 days), mock implementation (1 day)

**ADR-053 TTL and Garbage Collection**:
- Two-phase TTL strategy: consumer-driven cleanup + lifecycle policy safety net
- Configuration options: max_age (24h default), delete_after_read (true), retention_after_read (5min), grace_period (1h)
- Three configuration strategies: Aggressive (minimize storage cost), Conservative (handle slow consumers), Redelivery protection (handle retries)
- Producer: Set bucket lifecycle policy at startup, upload with metadata
- Consumer: Retrieve claim, verify checksum, conditionally delete based on configuration
- Proxy validation: TTL compatibility check between producer/consumer configs
- S3/MinIO lifecycle behavior: Bucket-level policies with daily/hourly processing
- Monitoring metrics: ClaimsCreated, ClaimsDeleted, ClaimNotFoundErrors, ClaimDeleteFailures
- Alerts: Storage leak detection, TTL too short detection, delete failure alerts
- Testing strategy with time simulation and MinIO lifecycle

**Test Framework Updates**:
- Added `PatternObjectStore` constant to framework/types.go
- Added `SupportsObjectStore` capability and `MaxObjectSize` to Capabilities struct
- Updated `HasCapability` function to recognize "ObjectStore" capability
- Framework now supports multi-pattern tests coordinating Producer + Consumer + ObjectStore

**Key Innovation**: Claim check pattern decouples message broker from large payload storage, using object storage economics (cheap, durable) while maintaining message broker simplicity. Namespace coordination ensures producer/consumer compatibility validated by proxy. Two-phase TTL strategy balances storage costs (immediate deletion) with safety (lifecycle policy backstop). MinIO provides production-like S3 testing without external dependencies.

**Impact**: Eliminates message broker size limits for large payloads (videos, images, ML models, datasets). Reduces message broker memory pressure and network congestion by 90%+ for large messages. Object storage costs 10-100x cheaper than message transfer. TTL automation prevents storage bloat. Namespace validation prevents misconfiguration errors. MinIO enables fast, realistic acceptance testing (<2s startup, full S3 compatibility). Foundation for handling multi-GB payloads through Prism with automatic claim lifecycle management. Addresses cost optimization, performance degradation, and size limit problems in messaging systems.

#### RFC-031: Payload Encryption with Post-Quantum Support + Producer Pattern Implementation (MAJOR UPDATE)
**Links**: [RFC-031](/rfc/rfc-031), [Producer Pattern](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/tree/main/patterns/producer), [Unified Test](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/tree/main/tests/acceptance/patterns/unified)

**Summary**: Comprehensive encryption support and producer pattern implementation with end-to-end testing:

**RFC-031 Encryption Enhancements**:
- **EncryptionMetadata Expanded**: Added support for symmetric, asymmetric, post-quantum, and hybrid encryption schemes
- **Encryption Types**: ENCRYPTION_TYPE_SYMMETRIC (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305), ENCRYPTION_TYPE_ASYMMETRIC (RSA-OAEP-4096, X25519), ENCRYPTION_TYPE_POST_QUANTUM (Kyber1024, ML-KEM), ENCRYPTION_TYPE_HYBRID (X25519+Kyber)
- **Key Management**: Keys NEVER stored in envelope - always referenced from configuration/secrets (Vault, AWS KMS, Kubernetes)
- **FIPS 140-3 Compliance**: Comprehensive table of approved algorithms with key sizes and standards (AES-256-GCM, RSA-4096, ML-KEM, SHA-256, HKDF-SHA256)
- **Deprecated Algorithm Warnings**: Explicit table marking weak algorithms (AES-128, RSA-2048, MD5, SHA-1, 3DES, RC4, DES) with replacements
- **Four Encryption Patterns**: Complete Go implementation examples for symmetric, asymmetric, post-quantum, and hybrid encryption
- **Key Rotation Best Practices**: 90-day rotation periods, 7-day overlap windows, per-namespace/topic key separation
- **Security Best Practices**: Nonce/IV reuse prevention, timing attack prevention, payload size limits, audit logging requirements
- **Vault/KMS Integration**: Configuration examples for HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, and Kubernetes secrets with production warnings
- **Go FIPS Libraries**: Documentation of FIPS-validated crypto libraries with import recommendations and GOFIPS=1 environment setup

**Producer Pattern Implementation**:
- **Full Pattern Implementation**: `patterns/producer/producer.go` (557 lines) with batching, retries, deduplication, and metrics
- **Configuration**: `patterns/producer/config.go` (139 lines) with comprehensive validation and duration parsing
- **Pattern Runner**: `patterns/producer/cmd/producer-runner/main.go` executable with backend initialization for NATS, Redis, MemStore
- **Slot Architecture**: MessageSink (PubSubInterface or QueueInterface) + StateStore (KeyValueBasicInterface for deduplication)
- **Batching Support**: Configurable batch size and interval with automatic flushing
- **Deduplication**: Content-based deduplication with configurable window (default 5 minutes)
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable max retries
- **Metrics Tracking**: Messages published, failed, deduplicated, bytes published, batches published, publish latency
- **State Management**: Producer state for deduplication cache using state store slot
- **Health Checks**: Returns health status with metrics summary

**Producer Acceptance Tests**:
- **Test Suite**: 5 comprehensive tests (BasicPublish, BatchedPublish, PublishWithRetry, Deduplication, ProducerMetrics)
- **Backend Support**: Tests run against MemStore, NATS, Redis with automatic backend discovery
- **Capability-Aware**: Tests skip when state store not available (deduplication tests)
- **Metrics Validation**: Verifies published count, failed count, deduplication count, bytes published
- **Health Validation**: Ensures producer reports healthy status with correct metrics

**Unified Producer+Consumer Test**:
- **End-to-End Integration**: `tests/acceptance/patterns/unified/producer_consumer_test.go` (416 lines)
- **Three Backend Configurations**: MemStore, NATS+MemStore, Redis (with testcontainers)
- **Test Scenarios**: Single message, multiple messages (5+), metrics validation, state persistence
- **Message Flow Verification**: Producer publishes → Consumer receives → Payload and metadata validated
- **State Persistence**: Verifies consumer state saved correctly when state store available
- **Performance Validation**: Ensures end-to-end latency within acceptable bounds

**CI/CD Workflow Updates**:
- Added `producer` to pattern acceptance test matrix
- Updated summary report to include producer pattern results
- Producer tests run in parallel with keyvalue and consumer patterns
- Coverage tracking for producer pattern implementation

**Key Innovation**: RFC-031 encryption now supports future-proof post-quantum algorithms (Kyber, ML-KEM) with FIPS compliance requirements enforced. Producer pattern provides symmetric counterpart to consumer pattern with batching, deduplication, and retry capabilities. Unified test demonstrates full end-to-end message flow from producer to consumer across multiple backend combinations.

**Impact**: Encryption support addresses quantum computing threats while maintaining FIPS compliance. Keys never stored in messages - always referenced from secrets providers (Vault/KMS). Producer pattern completes pub/sub foundation alongside consumer pattern. Unified tests validate real-world scenarios where producers and consumers coordinate via shared backend. Pattern-based testing framework now covers both publishing and consuming workflows. Foundation for building reliable message-driven architectures with zero-downtime migrations between backends.

#### Pattern-Based Acceptance Testing Framework - CI Migration Complete (MAJOR UPDATE)
**Links**: [MEMO-030](/memos/memo-030), [Pattern Acceptance Tests Workflow](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/.github/workflows/pattern-acceptance-tests.yml), [CI Workflow](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

**Summary**: Completed migration from backend-specific acceptance tests to pattern-based testing framework with comprehensive CI/CD integration:

**CI/CD Changes**:
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  * Replaced backend-specific `test-acceptance` job with pattern-based `test-acceptance-patterns`
  * Matrix strategy now tests patterns (keyvalue, consumer) instead of backends (redis, nats, interfaces)
  * Tests automatically run against ALL registered backends that support each pattern
  * Updated all job dependencies, coverage reports, and status checks
- Created `.github/workflows/pattern-acceptance-tests.yml`:
  * Dedicated workflow for pattern acceptance testing
  * Separate jobs for KeyValue and Consumer patterns
  * Comprehensive summary reporting showing backend coverage per pattern
  * Pattern-focused test results with coverage tracking
- Created `.github/workflows/acceptance-test-pattern.yml`:
  * Reusable workflow template for individual pattern testing
  * Supports matrix testing with different backend configurations
  * Extensible for future multi-backend pattern combinations
- Deprecated `.github/workflows/acceptance-tests.yml`:
  * Old backend-specific workflow now manual-trigger only
  * Added deprecation notice pointing to MEMO-030

**Test Code Fixes**:
- Fixed compilation errors in `tests/acceptance/patterns/keyvalue/`:
  * Changed all `core.KeyValueBasicInterface` references to `plugin.KeyValueBasicInterface`
  * Tests now compile and execute successfully
  * Verified execution against MemStore and Redis backends

**Documentation** (MEMO-030):
- Comprehensive 1000+ line guide to pattern-based testing architecture
- Side-by-side comparison with old backend-specific approach (MEMO-015)
- Complete architecture diagrams showing test execution flow
- Step-by-step guides for adding new patterns and backends
- Benefits analysis: 87% code reduction (write tests once, run everywhere)
- Migration guide from backend-specific to pattern-based approach

**Architecture Benefits**:
- ✅ **Zero duplication**: Tests written once, run on all compatible backends automatically
- ✅ **Pattern-focused**: Test pattern behavior (KeyValue, Consumer), not backend implementation
- ✅ **Auto-discovery**: Backends register at init() time, tests discover them dynamically
- ✅ **Easy backend addition**: 50 lines of registration code vs 400 lines of test duplication
- ✅ **Capability-aware**: Tests automatically skip when backend lacks required capabilities
- ✅ **Parallel execution**: Backends test concurrently for faster CI runs

**Test Organization**:
```
Before (Backend-Specific):
tests/acceptance/redis/redis_integration_test.go      # 200 lines
tests/acceptance/nats/nats_integration_test.go        # 300 lines
tests/acceptance/postgres/postgres_integration_test.go # 415 lines
→ 915 lines of duplicated test logic

After (Pattern-Based):
tests/acceptance/patterns/keyvalue/basic_test.go      # 232 lines
tests/acceptance/patterns/consumer/consumer_test.go   # 200 lines
→ 432 lines testing 3+ backends each (zero duplication)
```

**Key Innovation**: Pattern-based testing treats patterns as first-class citizens. Tests validate pattern contracts (KeyValueBasicInterface, ConsumerProtocol) against all backends that claim support. Backends register capabilities via framework, tests discover and execute automatically. Adding new backend requires only registration (~50 lines) - all existing pattern tests run immediately.

**Impact**: Eliminates test code duplication (87% reduction). Accelerates backend addition (50 lines vs 400 lines per backend). Ensures pattern behavior consistency across all backends. Simplifies CI/CD with pattern-focused workflows. Foundation for scaling to 10+ patterns and 20+ backends without duplicating test code. Deprecated old backend-specific workflows to prevent confusion.

### 2025-10-13

#### RFC-032: Minimal Prism Schema Registry for Local Testing (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-032](/rfc/rfc-032)

**Summary**: Lightweight schema registry implementation for local testing and acceptance tests without external dependencies:
- Fast local testing: &lt;100ms startup, in-memory storage, &lt;10MB memory footprint
- Confluent Schema Registry REST API compatibility (80% endpoint coverage)
- Schema format support: Protobuf (primary), JSON Schema, Avro (basic)
- Backward/forward/full compatibility checking
- Acceptance test baseline: All plugin tests use same registry
- Rust-based implementation for performance and small footprint
- Complete test infrastructure examples (Go fixtures, parallel tests)
- Interface coverage comparison: Confluent SR vs AWS Glue vs Apicurio vs Prism Minimal

**Key Innovation**: Minimal stand-in registry enables fast, realistic testing without JVM overhead (vs 1GB+ Confluent) or external cloud services. Single binary, no persistence, no authentication - purpose-built for local development and CI/CD.

**Impact**: Eliminates external dependencies in tests (no Confluent/Apicurio required). Reduces test startup from 30s to &lt;100ms. Enables parallel test execution with isolated registry instances per test. Foundation for plugin acceptance tests across all backends. Combined with testcontainers for realistic integration testing.

---

#### RFC-031: Message Envelope Protocol for Pub/Sub Systems (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-031](/rfc/rfc-031)

**Summary**: Unified protobuf-based message envelope protocol for consistent, flexible, and secure pub/sub across all backends:
- Single envelope format: Protobuf-based wrapper for all backends (Kafka, NATS, Redis, PostgreSQL, SQS)
- Backend abstraction: Prism SDK hides backend-specific serialization
- Core components: PrismMetadata (routing, TTL, priority), SecurityContext (auth, encryption, PII), ObservabilityContext (traces, metrics), SchemaContext (RFC-030 integration)
- Extension map for future-proofing: `map<string, bytes> extensions` for evolution without version bumps
- Envelope version field: Explicit versioning with backward/forward compatibility
- Developer APIs: Ergonomic Python/Go/Rust wrappers hiding envelope complexity
- Backend-specific serialization: Kafka (headers + value), NATS (headers + data), Redis (pub/sub message), PostgreSQL (JSONB column)
- Performance overhead: &lt;5% latency increase (+150 bytes envelope, ~0.5ms serialization)

**Key Innovation**: Protobuf envelope provides type-safe, evolvable metadata layer while remaining backend-agnostic. Security context enables auth token validation, message signing, PII awareness. Observability context integrates W3C Trace Context for distributed tracing. Schema context (RFC-030) carries schema metadata in every message.

**Impact**: Eliminates inconsistent message formats across backends. Enables cross-backend migrations without rewriting envelope logic. Built-in security (auth tokens, signatures, encryption metadata) and observability (traces, metrics labels) by default. Foundation for sustainable pub/sub development with 10+ year evolution path. Developer APIs maintain simplicity while envelope handles complexity.

---

#### RFC-030: Schema Evolution and Validation for Decoupled Pub/Sub (MAJOR UPDATE - v3)
**Link**: [RFC-030](/rfc/rfc-030)

**Summary**: Comprehensive governance, performance, and feasibility enhancements based on user feedback:

**Major Additions:**
- **Governance Tags (MAJOR)**: Schema-level and consumer-level tags for distributed teams
  - Schema tags: sensitivity, compliance, retention_days, owner_team, consumer_approval, audit_log, data_classification
  - Consumer tags: team, purpose, data_usage, pii_access, compliance_frameworks, allowed_fields, rate_limit
  - Field-level access control: Prism proxy auto-filters fields based on `allowed_fields`
  - Deprecation warnings: `@prism.deprecated` tag with date, reason, and migration guidance
  - Audit logging: Automatic compliance reporting for GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2 with field-level tracking
  - Consumer approval workflow: Mermaid diagram showing Jira/PagerDuty integration
- **Optional Field Enforcement**: Prism validates all fields are `optional` for backward compatibility
  - Enforcement levels: warn, enforce with exceptions, strict
  - Migration path for existing schemas with required fields
  - Python/Go examples for handling optional fields
- **Per-Message Validation Performance Trade-Offs**: Detailed analysis (+50% latency, -34% throughput)
  - Config-time vs build-time vs publish-time validation comparison
  - Pattern providers are schema-agnostic (binary passthrough)
  - Schema-specific consumers optional (type-safe generated code)
  - Sample rate validation for production debugging
- **Backend Schema Propagation**: SchemaAwareBackend interface for pushing schemas downstream
  - Kafka: POST to Confluent Schema Registry at config time
  - NATS: Stream metadata + message headers
  - PostgreSQL: Schema table with JSONB
  - S3: Object metadata
  - Config-time vs runtime propagation trade-offs
- **Build vs Buy Analysis**: Comprehensive feasibility study for custom Prism Schema Registry
  - Decision criteria table: multi-backend support, dev effort, performance, Git integration, PII governance
  - Recommendation: Build lightweight custom registry (Phase 1) + support existing (Phase 2)
  - Timeline: 8 weeks core registry, 4 weeks interoperability, 6 weeks federation
  - When to use matrix: new deployments, multi-backend, PII compliance, air-gapped
- **Schema Trust Verification**: `schema_name`, `sha256_hash`, `allowed_sources` for URL-based schemas
- **HTTPS Schema Registry**: Any HTTPS endpoint can serve schemas (not just GitHub/Prism Registry)
- **Inline Schema Removed**: Config now uses URL references only (no inline protobuf content)
- **Mermaid Diagrams Fixed**: Changed from ```text to ```mermaid for proper rendering

**Key Innovation**: Governance tags at Prism level enable platform teams to enforce policies (PII, compliance, retention) across distributed teams without manual coordination. Field-level access control (column security) prevents accidental PII exposure. Per-message validation analysis clarifies performance trade-offs (use config-time + build-time, not runtime). Backend schema propagation enables native tooling (Confluent clients, NATS CLI).

**Impact**: Distributed organizations with 10+ teams can now enforce schema governance policies automatically. Consumer approval workflows integrate with existing ticketing systems (Jira, PagerDuty). Field filtering prevents PII leaks at proxy level. Deprecation warnings with date/reason enable graceful field migrations. Comprehensive audit trails for GDPR/HIPAA compliance built-in. Optional field enforcement eliminates class of breaking changes. Build vs buy analysis provides clear decision framework for schema registry deployment.

#### Docusaurus BuildInfo Component - Time and Timezone Display Enhanced (UPDATED)
**Link**: [BuildInfo Component](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/docusaurus/src/components/BuildInfo/index.tsx)

**Summary**: Enhanced the BuildInfo component in the Docusaurus navbar to display full timestamp with time and timezone:

**Display Format Updated**:
- **Before**: `Oct 13` (date only)
- **After**: `Oct 13, 2:10 PM PDT` (date, time, timezone)

**Format Function Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Only month and day
return date.toLocaleString('en-US', {
  month: 'short',
  day: 'numeric',
});

// After: Full timestamp with timezone
return date.toLocaleString('en-US', {
  month: 'short',
  day: 'numeric',
  hour: 'numeric',
  minute: '2-digit',
  timeZoneName: 'short',
});
```

**Current Display in Navbar**:
- **Version/Commit**: `ebbc5f9` (7-character commit hash)
- **Separator**: `•` (bullet)
- **Timestamp**: `Oct 13, 2:10 PM PDT` (date + time + timezone)

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Desktop (>996px): Full display with all metadata
- Mobile (<996px): Only version shown, timestamp hidden

**Build Metadata Source**:
- Version: `git describe --tags --always`
- Build Time: `new Date().toISOString()`
- Commit Hash: `git rev-parse HEAD`
- All metadata auto-generated at build time

**Key Facts**: The BuildInfo component was already implemented with build metadata infrastructure in `docusaurus.config.ts`. This enhancement adds detailed time and timezone information to help users understand when the documentation was last built. Format uses browser's locale settings with US English as fallback.

**Impact**: Users can now see exactly when the documentation was last updated, including the specific time and timezone. Helps identify stale builds and provides confidence that they're viewing the latest version. Particularly useful for fast-moving projects where documentation changes frequently throughout the day.

```

**Script Usage**:
```bash
# Dry-run mode (preview changes)
uv run tooling/fix_broken_links.py --dry-run

# Apply fixes
uv run tooling/fix_broken_links.py
```

**Key Innovation**: Automated link fixing eliminates manual correction of documentation links. Script understands Docusaurus link resolution rules (short-form IDs, plugin boundaries, index.md handling) and systematically fixes broken links across the entire documentation corpus. Regex-based pattern matching handles all common link error types.

**Impact**: Eliminates 173 broken links that would have caused 404 errors for users. Documentation now passes validation with 100% link integrity. Automated script can be re-run anytime links break (e.g., after file renames or restructuring). Foundation for pre-commit hooks to prevent broken links from being committed. All 107 documents now have valid cross-references.

#### GitHub Actions Acceptance Test Summary Reporter (NEW)
**Links**: [tooling/acceptance_summary.py](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/tooling/acceptance_summary.py), [.github/workflows/acceptance-tests.yml](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/.github/workflows/acceptance-tests.yml)

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive acceptance test summary reporting for GitHub Actions workflow summaries using parallel matrix job aggregation:

**Test Result Collection**:
- JSON result files generated per matrix job (memstore, redis, nats)
- Test output captured with pattern matching for PASS/FAIL counts
- Go coverage reports generated and uploaded as artifacts
- All results aggregated in final summary job

**Summary Script** (`tooling/acceptance_summary.py`):
- Collects test results from JSON files across all matrix jobs
- Parses Go coverage files using `go tool cover -func`
- Generates GitHub-flavored Markdown for $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
- Creates comprehensive report with:
  - Overall status banner (✅ passed / ❌ failed)
  - Summary statistics (patterns tested, pass/fail counts, duration, average coverage)
  - Pattern results table (status, duration, coverage, test counts)
  - Failed test details in collapsible sections
  - Coverage visualization with progress bars

**Workflow Changes** (`.github/workflows/acceptance-tests.yml`):
- Matrix jobs now capture test output to `test-output.txt`
- Exit code and test counts extracted via grep patterns
- JSON results written to `build/acceptance-results/acceptance-{pattern}.json`
- Results and coverage uploaded as artifacts per pattern
- New `acceptance-summary` job downloads all artifacts and generates report
- Artifact directory flattening handles GitHub Actions nested structure

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Parallel execution**: Matrix jobs run independently (memstore, redis, nats)
- ✅ **Comprehensive aggregation**: Collects results from all patterns into single view
- ✅ **Coverage tracking**: Parses Go coverage reports and displays percentage per pattern
- ✅ **Visual reporting**: Progress bars, emojis, and collapsible sections for readability
- ✅ **Failed test debugging**: Last 50 lines of output shown for failed patterns
- ✅ **Reuses primitives**: Leverages existing patterns from `parallel_acceptance_test.py`

**Output Example**:
```markdown
## ✅ Acceptance Tests Passed

### 📊 Summary
- **Total Patterns:** 3
- **Passed:** 3 ✅
- **Failed:** 0 ❌
- **Duration:** 45.2s
- **Average Coverage:** 84.5%

### 🎯 Pattern Results
| Pattern | Status | Duration | Coverage | Tests |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| memstore | ✅ Passed | 12.5s | 85.3% | 10 passed |
| redis | ✅ Passed | 18.7s | 83.1% | 12 passed |
| nats | ✅ Passed | 14.0s | 85.1% | 11 passed |
```

**Key Innovation**: Aggregates parallel matrix job results into unified GitHub Actions summary using JSON intermediates and artifact downloads. Reuses Go coverage parsing and result collection patterns from existing parallel test infrastructure. Provides single-pane-of-glass view of all acceptance test results with visual coverage tracking.

**Impact**: Eliminates need to click through individual matrix jobs to understand acceptance test status. Summary appears immediately in GitHub Actions UI with all key metrics. Failed tests show relevant output for quick debugging. Coverage tracking ensures test quality is maintained across patterns. Foundation for adding more patterns to matrix (postgres, kafka) with automatic summary integration.

#### RFC-030: Schema Evolution and Validation for Decoupled Pub/Sub (UPDATED - v2)
**Link**: [RFC-030](/rfc/rfc-030)

**Summary**: Comprehensive RFC addressing schema evolution and validation for publisher/consumer patterns where producers and consumers are decoupled across async teams with different workflows and GitHub repositories:

**Core Problems Addressed**:
- Schema Discovery: Consumers can't find producer schemas without asking humans
- Version Mismatches: Producer evolves schema, consumer breaks at runtime
- Cross-Repo Workflows: Teams can't coordinate deploys across repositories
- Testing Challenges: Consumers can't test against producer changes before deploy
- Governance Vacuum: No platform control over PII tagging or compatibility

**Proposed Solution - Three-Tier Schema Registry**:
- **Tier 1: GitHub** (developer-friendly, Git-native) - Public schemas, PR reviews, version tags
- **Tier 2: Prism Schema Registry** (platform-managed, high performance) - <10ms fetch, governance hooks
- **Tier 3: Confluent Schema Registry** (Kafka-native) - Ecosystem integration for Kafka-heavy deployments

**Key Features**:
- Producer workflow: Define schema → Register → Publish with schema reference
- Consumer workflow: Discover schema → Validate compatibility → Subscribe with assertion
- Compatibility modes: Backward, Forward, Full, None (configurable per topic)
- PII governance: Mandatory @prism.pii tags validated at schema registration
- Breaking change detection: CI pipeline catches incompatible schemas before merge
- Code generation: `prism schema codegen` generates typed client code (Go, Python, Rust)

**Schema Validation Architecture**:
- Publish-time validation: Proxy validates payload matches declared schema (<15ms overhead)
- Consumer-side assertion: Opt-in schema version checking with on_mismatch policy
- Message headers: Attaches schema URL, version, hash to every message
- Cache-friendly: 1h TTL for GitHub schemas, aggressive caching for registry

**Governance and Security**:
- PII field tagging: Fields like email, phone require @prism.pii annotation
- Approval workflows: Breaking changes require platform team approval
- Audit logs: Who registered what schema, when
- Schema tampering protection: SHA256 hash verification, immutable versions

**Implementation Phases**:
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): GitHub-based registry with URL parsing and caching
- Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6): Schema validation (protobuf parser, compatibility checker)
- Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10): Prism Schema Registry gRPC service with SQLite/Postgres storage
- Phase 4 (Weeks 11-13): PII governance enforcement and approval workflows
- Phase 5 (Weeks 14-16): Code generation CLI for Go/Python/Rust

**Developer Workflows**:
- New producer: Create schema → Register → Generate client code → Publish
- Existing consumer: Discover schemas → Check compatibility → Update code → Deploy
- Platform governance: Audit PII tagging → Enforce compatibility → Approve breaking changes

**Real-World Scenarios Enabled**:
- E-commerce order events: Team A evolves order schema, Team B/C/D discover changes before deploy
- IoT sensor data: Gateway changes temperature from int to float, consumers test compatibility in CI
- User profile updates: PII leak prevention via mandatory field tagging

**Key Innovation**: Layered schema registry approach provides flexibility (GitHub for open-source, Prism Registry for enterprise, Confluent for Kafka). Producer/consumer decoupling maintained while enabling schema discovery, compatibility validation, and governance enforcement. Async teams with different workflows can evolve schemas safely without coordinated deploys.

**Impact**: Addresses PRD-001 goals (Accelerate Development, Enable Migrations, Reduce Operational Cost, Improve Reliability, Foster Innovation) by eliminating schema-related runtime failures and enabling safe schema evolution. Producers declare schemas via GitHub (familiar workflow) or Prism Registry (high performance). Consumers validate compatibility in CI/CD before breaking changes reach production. Platform enforces PII tagging and compatibility policies automatically. Foundation for multi-team pub/sub architectures where schema changes are frequent and coordination is expensive.

#### Prismctl OIDC Integration Test Infrastructure (NEW - Phases 1-3 Complete)
**Links**: [MEMO-022](/memos/memo-022), [Integration Tests README](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/cli/tests/integration/README.md)

**Summary**: Implemented Phases 1-3 of prismctl OIDC integration testing infrastructure to address the 60% coverage gap in authentication flows:

**Test Infrastructure Created**:
- `cli/tests/integration/` directory with complete test suite (24 tests)
- `docker-compose.dex.yml`: Local Dex OIDC server for testing
- `dex-config.yaml`: Test configuration with static test users (test@prism.local, admin@prism.local)
- `dex_server.py`: DexTestServer context manager for test lifecycle
- `conftest.py`: Pytest configuration with custom markers
- `README.md`: Comprehensive testing guide with troubleshooting

**Test Coverage** (24 tests total):
- `test_password_flow.py`: 5 tests (success, invalid username/password, empty credentials, multiple users)
- `test_token_refresh.py`: 6 tests (success, missing refresh token, invalid token, expiry extension, identity preservation, multiple refreshes)
- `test_userinfo.py`: 8 tests (success, expected claims, different users, expired token, invalid token, after refresh, empty token)
- `test_cli_endtoend.py`: 5 tests (login/logout cycle, whoami without login, invalid credentials, multiple cycles, different users)

**Makefile Integration**:
- `test-prismctl-integration`: Automated test runner with Dex lifecycle management
- Podman machine startup, Dex container management, cleanup on failure
- Coverage reporting with `pytest --cov=prismctl.auth`

**Key Features**:
- Local Dex server starts automatically via Podman Compose
- Health check waits for Dex readiness (5-second timeout)
- Temporary config generation per test (isolated test environments)
- Two static test users with password authentication
- Integration tests achieve **60% coverage** of OIDC flows (password, refresh, userinfo)
- Combined with unit tests: **85%+ coverage** for `prismctl/auth.py`

**Implementation Status** (Phases 1-3 Complete):
- ✅ Test infrastructure (Dex compose, config)
- ✅ DexTestServer utility class
- ✅ Makefile target
- ✅ Password flow tests (5 scenarios)
- ✅ Token refresh tests (6 scenarios)
- ✅ Userinfo endpoint tests (8 scenarios)
- ✅ CLI end-to-end tests (5 scenarios)
- ⏳ Device code flow tests (Phase 2 - requires browser mock)
- ⏳ Error handling tests (Phase 3 - network failures, timeouts)
- ⏳ CI/CD integration (Phase 4 - GitHub Actions)

**Key Innovation**: Local Dex server enables realistic OIDC flow testing without external dependencies or cloud services. DexTestServer context manager handles full lifecycle (start → wait → test → cleanup). CLI end-to-end tests verify complete workflows via subprocess calls (realistic usage patterns). Password flow tests serve as foundation for remaining OIDC flows (device code, authorization code).

**Impact**: Addresses MEMO-022 Phases 1-3 requirements. Prismctl authentication testing now has comprehensive integration coverage for password flow, token refresh, userinfo endpoints, and complete CLI workflows. CLI end-to-end tests verify login → whoami → logout cycles with error handling. Foundation established for Phase 4 (CI/CD integration). Combined unit + integration testing achieves 85%+ coverage goal with 24 total integration tests.

#### Podman Machine Setup Documentation (NEW)
**Links**: [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/BUILDING.md), [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)

**Summary**: Added comprehensive Podman machine setup instructions to fix "rootless Docker not found" error from testcontainers-go:

**BUILDING.md Troubleshooting Section**:
- New "Podman machine not running" troubleshooting entry
- Step-by-step instructions: `podman machine start` + `export DOCKER_HOST`
- Explanation linking to ADR-049 (why Podman over Docker Desktop)
- Alternative fast test approach: `go test -short ./...` (skips containers)
- Dynamic DOCKER_HOST setup using `podman machine inspect` command

**CLAUDE.md Development Workflow**:
- Added Podman machine startup to Setup section
- Included DOCKER_HOST environment variable configuration
- Documents that Podman machine is required for testcontainers

**Key Facts**: Per ADR-049, project uses Podman instead of Docker Desktop for container management. testcontainers-go library requires DOCKER_HOST environment variable to find Podman socket. Without this, integration tests fail with "panic: rootless Docker not found". Alternative is to run `go test -short` which skips integration tests and provides instant feedback (<1ms) using in-process backends (MemStore, SQLite).

**Impact**: Eliminates common setup error for new developers. Documents why Podman is used (ADR-049 decision). Provides both container-based and instant testing workflows. Developers can now run full acceptance tests with real backends or skip to instant feedback mode. Foundation for local development environment matches CI/CD infrastructure.

#### Parallel Linting System with Comprehensive Python Tooling Configuration (NEW)
**Links**: [MEMO-021](/memos/memo-021), [README.md](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/README.md), [.golangci.yml](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/.golangci.yml), [ruff.toml](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/ruff.toml)

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive parallel linting infrastructure achieving 54-90x speedup over sequential linting with complete Python tooling configuration:

**Parallel Linting System** ([MEMO-021](/memos/memo-021)):
- 10 linter categories running in parallel: critical, security, style, quality, errors, performance, bugs, testing, maintainability, misc
- 45+ Go linters (errcheck, govet, staticcheck, gofmt, gofumpt, goimports, gocritic, gosec, prealloc, and 36 more)
- AsyncIO-based Python runner with multi-module support for 15+ Go modules in monorepo
- Category-specific timeouts (critical: 10min, security: 5min, style: 3min)
- JSON output parsing for structured issue reporting
- Progress tracking with real-time status updates
- Complete migration guide from golangci-lint v1 to v2.5.0

**golangci-lint v2 Compatibility** (.golangci.yml):
- Updated to golangci-lint v2.5.0 with breaking changes handled
- Removed deprecated linters: gosimple (merged into staticcheck), typecheck (no longer a linter)
- Renamed linters: goerr113→err113, exportloopref→copyloopvar, tparallel→paralleltest, thelper→testifylint
- Changed output format: --out-format json → --output.json.path stdout
- Removed incompatible severity section from v1 configuration

**Python Linting Configuration** (ruff.toml):
- Comprehensive linting with 30+ rule sets: pycodestyle, Pyflakes, isort, pep8-naming, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, flake8-annotations, security (bandit), bugbear, comprehensions, and 20 more
- Per-file ignores for tooling scripts (allow print(), complexity, magic values, etc.)
- Auto-formatting with `ruff format` and auto-fixing with `ruff check --fix`
- Reduced from 1,317 violations to 0 violations across 30 tooling files
- Cleaned deprecated rules (ANN101, ANN102)

**Makefile Integration**:
- `make lint-parallel`: Run all 10 categories in parallel (fastest!)
- `make lint-parallel-critical`: Run critical + security only (fast feedback)
- `make lint-parallel-list`: List all available categories
- `make lint-fix`: Auto-fix issues across all languages (Go, Rust, Python)
- `make fmt-python`: Format Python code with ruff

**Multi-Module Monorepo Support**:
- Automatic discovery of all `go.mod` files in monorepo (15+ modules)
- Each module linted independently with full linter battery
- Single command lints entire codebase: `uv run tooling/parallel_lint.py`

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Sequential linting**: 45-75 minutes (15 modules × 3-5 min each)
- **Parallel linting**: 3.7 seconds for all 10 categories (0 issues found)
- **Speedup**: 54-90x faster
- **CI optimization**: Matrix strategy runs 4 categories in parallel for even faster feedback

**README Updates**:
- Added Linting section with parallel linting commands
- Documented 45+ Go linters across 10 categories
- Added link to MEMO-021 for comprehensive documentation
- Highlighted 3-4s linting time vs 45+ min sequential

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed Makefile binary naming issue: `proxy` → `prism-proxy` (matches Cargo.toml)
- Fixed both `build-proxy` and `build-dev` targets
- All builds now complete successfully

**Key Innovation**: Category-based parallel execution enables running comprehensive linter battery (45+ linters) in under 4 seconds by parallelizing independent categories. Multi-module discovery automatically handles monorepo structure. Python linting configuration with extensive per-file ignores makes ruff practical for utility scripts while maintaining code quality.

**Impact**: Dramatically reduces developer friction with fast linting feedback. CI builds complete faster with parallel matrix strategy. Python tooling now has consistent, automated formatting and linting. Multi-module monorepo structure fully supported without manual configuration. Foundation for pre-commit hooks with sub-second feedback for critical linters.

#### Documentation Structure Consistency Fixes (UPDATED)
**Commits**: 0209b7c, 936d405
**Links**: [README.md](https://github.com/jrepp/prism-data-layer/blob/main/README.md), [ADR-042](/adr/adr-042)

**Summary**: Fixed documentation inconsistencies to reflect actual project structure using `patterns/` directory instead of legacy `backends/` references:

**README.md Project Structure Fix** (0209b7c):
- Corrected "Pluggable Backends" section directory structure from `backends/` to `patterns/`
- Updated subdirectory listing to match actual implementation: core/, memstore/, redis/, nats/, kafka/, postgres/
- Ensures new contributors see accurate project structure

**ADR-042 File Path Correction** (936d405):
- Fixed implementation code comment from `plugins/backends/sqs/plugin.go` to `patterns/sqs/plugin.go`
- Aligns with project's pattern-based architecture where backend implementations live in patterns/ directory

**Key Facts**: Polish pass identified two instances where documentation still referenced old directory structure. Both README.md and ADR-042 now accurately reflect that backend implementations live in the `patterns/` directory, not `backends/` or `plugins/backends/`. All validation and linting passed cleanly after fixes.

**Impact**: Eliminates confusion for new contributors who would have followed documentation pointing to non-existent directories. Documentation now matches actual project structure. Future backend implementations will reference correct paths based on these fixes.

---

#### Documentation Consolidation and Canonical Changelog Migration (MAJOR UPDATE)
**Links**: [Key Documents Index](/docs/key-documents), [MEMO-015](/memos/memo-015), [MEMO-016](/memos/memo-016), [PRD](/prds/prd-001)

**Summary**: Major documentation consolidation establishing canonical changelog location and migrating temporary root directory documentation to docs-cms:

**Canonical Changelog Established**:
- Migrated docs-cms/CHANGELOG.md to `docusaurus/docs/changelog.md` (this file)
- Updated CLAUDE.md to document `docusaurus/docs/changelog.md` as **canonical changelog location**
- Updated monorepo structure diagram showing docusaurus/docs/ as home for changelog
- All future documentation changes MUST be logged here

**Root Directory Documentation Migration**:
- **MEMO-015**: Cross-Backend Acceptance Test Framework (from CROSS_BACKEND_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md)
  - Table-driven, property-based testing with random data
  - 10 comprehensive scenarios × 3 backends (Redis, MemStore, PostgreSQL)
  - 100% passing tests with backend isolation via testcontainers
  - Interface compliance verification for KeyValueBasicInterface
- **MEMO-016**: Observability & Lifecycle Implementation (from IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
  - OpenTelemetry tracing with configurable exporters
  - Prometheus metrics endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics)
  - Graceful shutdown handling and signal management
  - 62% reduction in backend driver boilerplate (65 → 25 lines)
- **PRD**: Product Requirements Document migrated to docs-cms/prd.md
  - Core foundational document defining vision, success metrics, and roadmap
  - Now accessible via Docusaurus navigation

**Key Documents Index Created**:
- New `docusaurus/docs/key.md` referencing philosophy-driving documents
- Organized by category: Vision & Requirements, Architectural Foundations, Implementation Philosophy, Development Practices, Testing & Quality
- Includes PRD, ADR-001 through ADR-004, MEMO-004, MEMO-006, RFC-018, CLAUDE.md, MEMO-015, MEMO-016
- Document hierarchy diagram showing WHY (PRD) → WHAT (ADRs) → HOW (MEMOs/RFCs) → WORKFLOWS (CLAUDE.md)

**Temporary Files Removed**:
- Removed obsolete files: MAKEFILE_UPDATES.md, SESSION_COMPLETE.md, conversation.txt
- Root directory now clean with only essential files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, BUILDING.md)

**CLAUDE.md Updates**:
- Added critical requirement: "When making documentation changes, ALWAYS update `docusaurus/docs/changelog.md`"
- Updated documentation authority section to reflect both `docs-cms/` and `docusaurus/docs/` locations
- Clarified that docusaurus/docs/changelog.md is the canonical changelog (not docs-cms/CHANGELOG.md)

**Key Innovation**: Establishes clear documentation home for each type of content. ADRs/RFCs/MEMOs live in docs-cms/ (versioned, plugin-based), while Docusaurus-specific content (changelog, key index) lives in docusaurus/docs/. Key documents index provides curated entry point for new contributors.

**Impact**: Eliminates confusion about changelog location (single source of truth). Root directory cleanup removes stale documentation. Key documents index accelerates onboarding by highlighting philosophy-driving documents. All temporary documentation now properly categorized and accessible via Docusaurus navigation.

#### Test and Build Fixes (UPDATED)
**Commits**: 39f4992, 57f819d

**Summary**: Fixed critical test failures and lint issues preventing clean builds:

**Test Failure Fix** (39f4992):
- Removed non-existent `ttl_seconds` field from KeyValueBasicInterface test
- Issue: Test code referenced field not in proto definition
- SetRequest only has: key, value, tags (no ttl_seconds in basic interface)
- All tests now pass: Rust proxy (18 tests), Go patterns (all passed), acceptance tests (100+ tests)

**Protobuf Module Structure Fix** (57f819d):
- Fixed proto file organization mismatch between Makefile and Rust code
- Updated Makefile to use correct paths (prism/interfaces/ instead of prism/pattern/)
- Updated proxy/src/proto.rs to include both interfaces and interfaces.keyvalue modules
- Fixed all Rust imports from proto::pattern to proto::interfaces/interfaces::keyvalue
- Changed service names to match proto definitions (LifecycleInterface, KeyValueBasicInterface)
- Removed batch operations not in KeyValueBasicInterface
- Fixed clippy warning (removed useless .into() conversion)
- All lint checks now pass (Rust clippy + Go vet)

**Key Facts**: Root cause was proto file reorganization to prism/interfaces/ structure but Makefile and Rust code still referenced old prism/pattern/ paths. Both issues discovered during `make test` and `make lint` runs. Fixes enable clean CI builds.

**Impact**: Development can proceed with passing tests and lint. Build pipeline unblocked. Foundation for POC 1 implementation is stable.

#### POC 1 Infrastructure Analysis Documentation (NEW)
**Commit**: 48ee562
**Link**: [MEMO-013](/memos/memo-013)

**Summary**: Comprehensive analysis of Pattern SDK shared complexity and load testing framework evaluation:

**Documents Created**:
- **MEMO-014** (Pattern SDK): Pattern SDK Shared Complexity Analysis
- **RFC-029** (Load Testing): Load Testing Framework Evaluation and Strategy
- **MEMO-013**: POC 1 Infrastructure Analysis (synthesis document)

**Note**: Original numbering (MEMO-012, RFC-023) conflicted with existing documents. Renumbered to MEMO-014 and RFC-029 to maintain sequence integrity.

**Key Findings**:
- 38% code reduction potential by extracting shared complexity to Pattern SDK
- Two-tier load testing strategy: custom tool (pattern-level) + ghz (integration-level)
- 12 areas of duplication across POC 1 plugins (MemStore, Redis, Kafka)
- Recommended SDK enhancements: connection pool, TTL manager, health check framework

**Pattern SDK Analysis** (MEMO-014):
- Connection pool manager reduces Redis/Kafka code by ~270 lines
- TTL manager with heap-based expiration scales to 100K+ keys (vs per-key timers)
- Health check framework standardizes status reporting
- Implementation plan: 2-week sprint (5 days SDK + 2 days refactoring)
- Expected: 2100 LOC → 1300 LOC (38% reduction)

**Load Testing Evaluation** (RFC-029):
- Evaluated 5 frameworks: ghz (24/30), k6 (20/30), fortio (22/30), vegeta (disqualified), hey/bombardier (disqualified)
- Recommendation: Keep custom prism-loadtest + add ghz for integration testing
- Two-tier strategy: pattern-level (prism-loadtest) + integration-level (ghz)
- Custom tool validated by MEMO-010 (100 req/sec, precise rate limiting, thread-safe)

**POC 1 Infrastructure Synthesis** (MEMO-013):
- Combines SDK refactoring + load testing enhancements
- Timeline: 2-week sprint alongside POC 1 implementation
- Deliverables: Enhanced SDK packages, two-tier load testing, 38% code reduction
- Success metrics: coverage targets (85%+), performance baselines, reduced plugin LOC

**Key Facts**: Analysis based on RFC-021 POC 1 plugin designs. All three documents validated with `uv run tooling/validate_docs.py` (101 docs, 0 errors). Implementation can proceed in parallel with POC 1.

**Impact**: Provides clear roadmap for Pattern SDK enhancements. Establishes comprehensive load testing strategy. Sets foundation for maintainable, testable plugin implementations.

#### MEMO-012: Developer Experience and Common Workflows (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-012](/memos/memo-012)

**Summary**: Practical guide documenting actual developer workflows, common commands, and testing patterns:
- **Core Commands**: Documentation validation, pattern builds, proxy runs, load testing
- **Mental Models**: Three-layer testing (unit → integration → load), TDD workflow (red → green → refactor)
- **Speed Optimization**: Skip full validation during iteration, parallel testing, incremental builds, reuse running backends
- **Common Shortcuts**: Bash aliases, Docker Compose profiles, Go test shortcuts
- **Integration Test Setup**: Multicast Registry example with Redis + NATS backends
- **Documentation Workflow**: Creating new docs with frontmatter templates, validation steps
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark comparison, load test profiles (quick/standard/stress)
- **Debugging**: gRPC tracing, race detector, container logs
- **CI/CD**: Pre-commit checklist (tests, race detector, coverage, docs validation, builds)
- **Fast Iteration Loop**: Watch mode with auto-rebuild and continuous testing

**Key Facts**: Covers only what exists in the codebase - no invented workflows. Includes actual commands from Makefiles, CLAUDE.md, and tooling scripts. Documents three-layer testing approach (MemStore/SQLite → Docker backends → full load tests) for speed optimization.

**Impact**: Provides single reference for new developers to understand actual development practices. Shows how to speed up multi-tier testing by reusing backends and running partial validations. Establishes consistent mental models for TDD and testing layers.

#### CI Validation Fixes - MDX Syntax and Broken Links (UPDATED)
**Links**: [MEMO-009](/memos/memo-009), [MEMO-010](/memos/memo-010), [RFC-029](/rfc/rfc-029)

**Summary**: Fixed MDX compilation errors and broken links identified by CI validation:
- **MEMO-009**: Escaped `<` character in line 87 (`<1KB` → `&lt;1KB`), added `text` language identifier to code fence on line 322, fixed broken link from `/pocs/poc-004-multicast-registry` to `/memos/memo-009` on line 369, updated relative path to absolute GitHub URL on line 372
- **MEMO-010**: Escaped all unescaped `<` characters in performance comparison tables (lines 22, 75, 97, 124, 135, 275, 322, 323) to `&lt;`
- **RFC-029**: Renamed from RFC-022 to RFC-029 (proper RFC numbering sequence)

**Key Facts**: All validation errors resolved. Code fences now have proper language identifiers (prevents "Unexpected FunctionDeclaration" MDX errors). HTML entities properly escaped (`<` → `&lt;`, `>` → `&gt;`). Links updated to use `/memos/` paths instead of deprecated `/pocs/` paths. Full validation passes with GitHub Pages build successful.

**Impact**: CI builds now pass successfully. MDX compilation errors eliminated. Documentation correctly renders in Docusaurus with proper code syntax highlighting. Users can navigate to correct memo pages without 404 errors.

---

#### Documentation Consistency Pass - Pattern SDK Terminology (UPDATED)
**Links**: [RFC-019](/rfc/rfc-019), [RFC-021](/rfc/rfc-021), [MEMO-008](/memos/memo-008), [MEMO-009](/memos/memo-009)

**Summary**: Completed comprehensive consistency pass to align all documentation with RFC-022 terminology change from "Plugin SDK" to "Pattern SDK":
- **RFC-019**: Updated title, module paths (`github.com/prism/plugin-sdk` → `github.com/prism/pattern-sdk`), directory references (`plugins/` → `patterns/`), and all references throughout
- **RFC-021**: Updated all "Plugin SDK" references to "Pattern SDK" and "plugins" to "patterns" in technology stack, work streams, and deliverables
- **MEMO-008**: Updated module path in code examples and directory references in Vault token exchange flow documentation
- **MEMO-009**: Updated cross-reference link to RFC-019 with correct short-form path

**Key Facts**: All 4 documents now use consistent "Pattern SDK" terminology. Cross-references updated to use short-form paths (`/rfc/rfc-019` instead of `/rfc/rfc-019`). Validation passed with no errors. Revision history entries added to all updated documents.

**Impact**: Eliminates terminology confusion between the Go-based Pattern SDK (for backend patterns) and Rust-based plugin SDK (for proxy plugins). Ensures developers reading documentation see consistent terminology across all RFCs and memos. All documentation now accurately reflects the architectural sophistication of the pattern layer.

### 2025-10-09

#### RFC-022: Core Pattern SDK - Build System and Tooling Added (MAJOR UPDATE)
**Link**: [RFC-022](/rfc/rfc-022)

**Summary**: Major update transforming RFC-022 from physical code layout to comprehensive build system and tooling guide:
- **Terminology Update**: Renamed from "Plugin SDK" to "Pattern SDK" to reflect pattern layer sophistication
- **Module Path Change**: `github.com/prism/plugin-sdk` → `github.com/prism/pattern-sdk`
- **Directory Structure**: `examples/` → `patterns/` to emphasize pattern implementations
- **Comprehensive Makefile System**: Hierarchical Makefiles for SDK and individual patterns
  - Root Makefile: `all`, `build`, `test`, `test-unit`, `test-integration`, `lint`, `proto`, `clean`, `coverage`, `validate`, `fmt`
  - Pattern-specific Makefiles: Build, test, lint, run, docker, clean targets
  - Build targets reference table with usage guidance
- **Compile-Time Validation**: Interface implementation checks, pattern interface validation, slot configuration validation
  - `interfaces/assertions.go`: Compile-time type assertions for all interfaces
  - `tools/validate-interfaces.sh`: Validates all patterns compile successfully
  - `tools/validate-slots/main.go`: YAML-based slot configuration validator
- **Linting Configuration**: Complete `.golangci.yml` with 12+ enabled linters
  - errcheck, gosimple, govet, ineffassign, staticcheck, typecheck, unused, gofmt, goimports, misspell, goconst, gocyclo, lll, dupl, gosec, revive
  - Test file exclusions, generated file exclusions
  - Pre-commit hook: `.githooks/pre-commit` runs format, lint, validate, test-unit
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test organization and coverage gates
  - Unit tests vs integration tests (build tags)
  - Testcontainers integration (`testing/containers.go`)
  - 80% coverage threshold enforcement
  - Benchmark tests with pattern examples
  - Extended CI/CD workflow with validation, lint, unit, integration, coverage gates

**Key Innovation**: Build system treats patterns as first-class sophisticated implementations, not simple "plugins". Comprehensive tooling ensures quality gates (lint, validate, test, coverage) are enforced at every stage. Makefile-based workflow enables fast iteration with incremental builds and caching. Compile-time validation catches configuration errors before runtime.

**Impact**: Establishes production-grade build infrastructure for Pattern SDK. Pattern authors get consistent Makefile targets, automated validation, and quality gates. Pre-commit hooks prevent broken code from being committed. Coverage gates ensure test quality. Testcontainers enable realistic integration testing. Complements RFC-025 (pattern architecture) by focusing on build system and tooling rather than concurrency primitives.

#### MEMO-009: Topaz Local Authorizer Configuration for Development and Integration Testing (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-009](/memos/memo-009)

**Summary**: Comprehensive guide for configuring Topaz as local authorizer across two scenarios:
- **Development Iteration**: Fast, lightweight authorization during local development with Docker Compose
- **Integration Testing**: Realistic authorization testing in CI/CD with testcontainers
- Local infrastructure layer: Reusable components (Topaz, Dex, Vault, Signoz) running independently
- Seed data setup with bootstrap script creating test users (dev@local.prism, admin@local.prism) and groups
- Policy files for main authorization (prism.rego) and namespace isolation
- Developer workflow: Docker Compose startup, directory bootstrap, policy hot-reload
- Integration testing: Go testcontainers setup, GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration
- Troubleshooting guide: 4 common issues with diagnosis and solutions
- Pattern SDK integration: Configuration for local Topaz with enforcement modes
- Comparison table: Development vs Integration Testing vs Production configurations

**Key Innovation**: Topaz as local infrastructure layer component enables fast development iteration (&lt;3s startup) and realistic integration testing (&lt;5s per test suite) without external dependencies. Bootstrap script provides reproducible test data. Policy hot-reload eliminates restart cycles.

**Impact**: Completes local development stack for authorization testing. Patterns can develop against realistic authorization without cloud services. testcontainers integration ensures CI/CD tests match production behavior. Establishes reusable local infrastructure pattern for other services (Dex, Vault, Signoz).

---

#### RFC-025: Pattern SDK Architecture - Pattern Lifecycle Management Added (MAJOR UPDATE)
**Link**: [RFC-025](/rfc/rfc-025)

**Summary**: Major expansion adding comprehensive pattern lifecycle management to Pattern SDK architecture:
- **Slot Matching via Config**: Backends validated against union of required interfaces at pattern slots
  - SlotConfig defines interface requirements (keyvalue_basic + keyvalue_scan)
  - SlotMatcher validates backends implement ALL required interfaces before assignment
  - Fail-fast validation: Pattern won't start if slots improperly configured
  - Optional slots supported (e.g., durability slot for event replay)
- **Lifecycle Isolation**: Pattern main separated from program main
  - SDK handles: config loading, backend initialization, slot validation, signal handling
  - Pattern implements: Initialize, Start, Shutdown, HealthCheck
  - Simple cmd/main.go just calls lifecycle.Run(pattern)
- **Graceful Shutdown with Bounded Timeout**: Configurable cleanup timeouts
  - graceful_timeout: 30s (pattern drains in-flight requests)
  - shutdown_timeout: 35s (hard deadline for forced exit)
  - Pattern drains worker pools, closes connections, waits for background goroutines
  - Exit codes: 0 (clean), 1 (errors), 2 (timeout forced)
- **Signal Handling at SDK Level**: OS signals intercepted by SDK
  - SIGTERM/SIGINT → SDK creates shutdown context → calls pattern.Shutdown(ctx)
  - Pattern isolated from signal complexity
  - Consistent signal handling across all patterns
- **Complete Example**: Multicast Registry pattern showing full lifecycle integration
  - Initialize: Extracts validated backends from slots, creates concurrency primitives
  - Start: Launches worker pool, health check loop, blocks until stop signal
  - Shutdown: Drains workers, closes backends, bounded by context timeout
  - HealthCheck: Circuit breaker-protected backend health verification

**Key Innovation**: Slot-based configuration with interface validation eliminates runtime errors from misconfigured backends. Lifecycle isolation keeps patterns focused on business logic while SDK handles cross-cutting concerns. Bounded graceful shutdown ensures clean deployments in Kubernetes (pod termination respects shutdown_timeout).

**Impact**: Patterns become significantly simpler to implement (no signal handling, config parsing, slot validation). Slot matcher prevents "backend doesn't support X interface" runtime errors. Graceful shutdown with hard timeout prevents hung deployments. Foundation for production-grade pattern implementations in POC phases.

### 2025-10-09 (Earlier)

#### RFC-019: Plugin SDK Authorization Layer - Token Validation Pushed to Plugins with Vault Integration (ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE)
**Link**: [RFC-019](/rfc/rfc-019)

**Summary**: Major architectural update reflecting critical design decision to push token validation and credential exchange to plugins (not proxy):
- **Architectural Rationale**: Token validation is high-latency (~10-50ms) per-session operation, not per-request
- **Proxy Role Change**: Proxy now passes tokens through without validation (stateless forwarding)
- **Plugin-Side Validation**: Plugins validate tokens once per session, then cache validation result
- **Vault Integration**: Complete implementation of token exchange for per-session backend credentials
  - Plugins exchange validated user JWT for Vault token
  - Vault token used to fetch dynamic backend credentials (username/password)
  - Per-session credentials enable user-specific audit trails in backend logs
  - Automatic credential renewal every lease_duration/2 (background goroutine)
- **VaultClient Implementation**: Complete Go SDK code for JWT login, credential fetching, lease renewal
- **Credential Lifecycle**: Mermaid diagram showing session setup → token exchange → credential renewal → session teardown
- **Configuration Examples**: YAML showing Vault address, JWT auth path, secret path, renewal intervals
- **Vault Policy Examples**: HCL policy for plugin access to database credentials and lease renewal
- **Benefits**: Per-user audit trails, fine-grained ACLs, automatic rotation, rate limiting per user

**Key Innovation**: Token validation amortized over session lifetime (validate once, reuse claims). Vault provides dynamic, short-lived credentials (1h TTL) with user-specific ACLs generated on-demand. Backend logs show which user accessed what data (not just "plugin user"). Zero shared long-lived credentials - breach of one session doesn't compromise others.

**Impact**: Enables true zero-trust architecture with per-session credential isolation. Backend databases can enforce row-level security using Vault-generated credentials. Plugin-side validation creates defense-in-depth even if proxy bypassed. Vault manages entire credential lifecycle (generation, renewal, revocation). Foundation for multi-tenant data access with user attribution.

#### RFC-002: Data Layer Interface Specification - Code Fence Formatting Fixes (UPDATED)
**Link**: [RFC-002](/rfc/rfc-002)

**Summary**: Fixed 4 MDX code fence validation errors identified by documentation validation tooling:
- Line 1156: Fixed closing fence with ```go → ``` (removed language identifier from closing fence)
- Line 1162: Fixed opening fence missing language → added ```text
- Line 1168: Fixed closing fence with ```bash → ``` (removed language identifier from closing fence)
- Line 1177: Fixed opening fence missing language → added ```text
- Applied state machine-based Python script to distinguish opening fences (require language) from closing fences (must be plain)
- All 4 errors resolved, documentation now passes MDX compilation

**Impact**: RFC-002 now compiles correctly in Docusaurus build. Fixes broken GitHub Pages deployment. Ensures code examples display properly with correct syntax highlighting.

---

#### RFC-023: Publish Snapshotter Plugin - Write-Only Event Buffering with Pagination (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-023](/rfc/rfc-023)

**Summary**: Comprehensive RFC defining publish snapshotter plugin architecture for write-only event capture with intelligent buffering:
- **Write-Only API**: Satisfies PubSub publish interface only (no subscription)
- Intelligent buffering with configurable thresholds (event count, size, age)
- Page-based commits to object storage (S3, MinIO, local filesystem)
- Index publishing to KeyValue/TimeSeries/Document backends for discovery
- Session disconnect handling with guaranteed zero data loss
- Format flexibility: Protobuf or NDJSON serialization with optional compression (gzip/zstd)
- Two backend slots: storage_object (new interface) + index backend (KeyValue/TimeSeries/Document)
- Complete page lifecycle: buffer → serialize → compress → write → index → clear
- Query and replay capabilities using index metadata
- Performance characteristics: 10,000 events/page, 300s max age, &lt;1GB RAM per 1000 writers
- Configuration examples: development (MemStore + local filesystem), production (Redis + MinIO), large scale (ClickHouse + S3)

**Key Innovation**: Write-only event capture decouples data producers from consumers, enabling durable event archival without active subscribers. Two-slot architecture separates storage (object storage) from indexing (KeyValue/TimeSeries) for flexibility. Page-based commits provide efficient large-file writes while maintaining discoverability through side-channel index.

**Impact**: Enables audit logging, event archival, data lake ingestion, session recording, and metrics collection patterns without requiring active consumers. Zero data loss guarantee even on disconnects. Object storage economics (cheap, durable) combined with queryable index. Adds new storage_object interface to MEMO-006 catalog.

---

#### RFC-022: Core Plugin SDK Physical Code Layout (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-022](/rfc/rfc-022)

**Summary**: Comprehensive RFC defining physical code layout for publishable Go SDK (`github.com/prism/plugin-sdk`) for building backend plugins:
- **Package Structure**: 9 packages (auth, authz, audit, plugin, interfaces, storage, observability, testing, errors)
- Clean separation: Authentication (JWT/OIDC), authorization (Topaz), audit logging, lifecycle management
- Interface contracts matching protobuf service definitions (KeyValue, PubSub, Stream, Queue, etc.)
- Observability built-in: structured logging (Zap), Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing
- Testing utilities: mock implementations for auth/authz/audit, test server helpers
- Minimal external dependencies: gRPC, protobuf, JWT libraries, Topaz SDK, Zap, Prometheus, OTel
- Semantic versioning strategy with Go modules (v0.x.x pre-1.0, v1.x.x stable, v2.x.x breaking)
- Complete example: MemStore plugin using SDK (150 lines vs 500+ without SDK)
- Automated releases with GitHub Actions
- godoc-friendly documentation with usage examples per package

**Key Innovation**: Batteries-included SDK enables plugin authors to focus on backend-specific logic while SDK handles cross-cutting concerns (auth, authz, audit, observability, lifecycle). Defense-in-depth authorization built into SDK following RFC-019 patterns. Reusable abstractions eliminate code duplication across plugins.

**Impact**: Accelerates plugin development with consistent patterns. Ensures all plugins enforce authorization, emit audit logs, and expose observability metrics. Reduces security vulnerabilities through centralized auth logic. Single SDK version bump propagates improvements to all plugins. Foundation for POC 1 implementation (RFC-021).

---

#### RFC-021: POC 1 - Three Minimal Plugins Implementation Plan (COMPLETE REWRITE)
**Link**: [RFC-021](/rfc/rfc-021)

**Summary**: Complete rewrite of POC 1 implementation plan based on user feedback for focused, test-driven approach:
- **Scope Changes**: Removed Admin API (use prismctl CLI), removed Python client library, split into 3 minimal plugins
- Three focused plugins: MemStore (in-memory, 6 interfaces), Redis (external, 8 interfaces), Kafka (streaming, 7 interfaces)
- Core Plugin SDK skeleton: Reusable Go library from RFC-022 with auth/authz/audit stubs
- Load testing tool: Go CLI (prism-load) for parallel request generation with configurable concurrency, duration, RPS
- Optimized builds: Static linking (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), scratch-based Docker images (&lt;10MB target)
- TDD workflow: Write tests FIRST, achieve 80%+ code coverage (SDK: 85%+, plugins: 80%+)
- Go module caching: Shared GOMODCACHE and GOCACHE across monorepo to avoid duplicate builds
- Plugin lifecycle diagram: 4 phases (startup, request handling, health checks, shutdown)
- 8 work streams with dependencies: Protobuf (1 day), SDK (2 days), Proxy (3 days), 3 plugins (2 days each), Load tester (1 day), Build optimization (1 day)
- Timeline: 2 weeks (10 working days) with parallelizable work streams
- Success criteria: All tests pass, 80%+ coverage, &lt;5ms P99 latency, &lt;10MB Docker images

**Key Innovation**: Walking Skeleton approach proves architecture end-to-end with minimal scope. Three focused plugins demonstrate SDK reusability and different backend patterns (in-process, external cache, external streaming). TDD workflow with mandatory code coverage gates ensures quality from day one. Load testing validates performance claims early.

**Impact**: Clear, achievable POC scope replacing original overly-complex plan. SDK skeleton provides foundation for all future plugins. Static linking enables lightweight deployments. TDD discipline establishes engineering culture. Load tester enables continuous performance validation. Coverage thresholds prevent quality regressions.

#### RFC-015: Plugin Acceptance Test Framework - Interface-Based Testing (COMPLETE REWRITE)
**Link**: [RFC-015](/rfc/rfc-015)

**Summary**: Complete rewrite aligning with MEMO-006 interface decomposition principles, shifting from backend-type testing to interface-based testing:
- **Interface Compliance**: 45 interface test suites (one per interface from MEMO-006 catalog)
- Cross-backend test reuse: Same test suite validates multiple backends implementing same interface
- Registry-driven testing: Backends declare interfaces in `registry/backends/*.yaml`, tests verify claims
- Compliance matrix: Automated validation that backends implement all declared interfaces
- Test organization: `tests/acceptance/interfaces/{datamodel}/{interface}_test.go` structure
- testcontainers integration: Real backend instances (Redis, Postgres, Kafka) for integration testing
- Example test suites: KeyValueBasicTestSuite (10 tests), KeyValueScanTestSuite (6 tests)
- GitHub Actions CI: Matrix strategy runs interface × backend combinations (45 interfaces × 4 backends = 180 jobs)
- Backend registry loading: `LoadBackendRegistry()` reads YAML declarations, `FindBackendsImplementing()` filters by interface
- Makefile targets: `test-compliance`, `test-compliance-redis`, `test-interface INTERFACE=keyvalue_basic`

**Key Innovation**: Interface-based testing enables test code reuse across backends. Single `KeyValueBasicTestSuite` validates Redis, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MemStore - reduces 1500 lines (duplicated) to 100 lines (shared). Registry-driven execution ensures only declared interfaces are tested (no false failures).

**Impact**: Dramatically reduces test maintenance burden. Establishes clear interface contracts through executable specifications. Backend registry becomes single source of truth for capabilities. Compliance matrix provides confidence that backends satisfy declared interfaces. Foundation for plugin acceptance testing in CI/CD pipeline.

#### RFC-020: Streaming HTTP Listener - API-Specific Adapter Pattern (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-020](/rfc/rfc-020)

**Summary**: Comprehensive RFC defining streaming HTTP listener architecture that bridges external HTTP/JSON protocols to Prism's internal gRPC/Protobuf layer:
- **API-Specific Adapters**: Each adapter implements ONE external API contract (MCP, Agent-to-Agent, custom APIs)
- Thin translation layer with no business logic (pure protocol translation)
- Streaming support: SSE (Server-Sent Events), WebSocket, HTTP chunked encoding
- Three deployment options: sidecar, separate service, or serverless (AWS Lambda)
- MCP backend interface decomposition: 5 interfaces across 3 data models (KeyValue, Queue, Stream)
- New MCP interfaces: mcp_tool (tool calling), mcp_resource (resource access), mcp_prompt (prompt templates)
- AI tool orchestration pattern: Combines MCP backend + execution queue + result stream
- Performance: &lt;3ms P95 adapter overhead, 30,000 RPS with HTTP/JSON translation
- Complete Go implementation examples with protocol translation helpers
- Configuration examples for MCP tool server, SSE event streaming, and agent-to-agent coordination

**Key Innovation**: API-specific adapters satisfy external protocol contracts while transparently mapping to internal gRPC primitives. MCP treated as backend plugin with decomposed interfaces following MEMO-006 principles. Enables AI tool calling, resource access, and prompt management via HTTP/JSON while leveraging Prism's backend flexibility.

**Impact**: Enables seamless integration of HTTP-based APIs (MCP, A2A) with Prism's gRPC core without modifying proxy. Easy adapter authoring pattern for new protocols. MCP backend decomposition provides foundation for AI tool orchestration with queue-based execution and result streaming.

#### ADR-050: Topaz for Policy-Based Authorization (NEW)
**Link**: [ADR-050](/adr/adr-050)

**Summary**: Architecture decision to use Topaz by Aserto for fine-grained policy-based authorization:
- **Topaz Selection**: Evaluated OPA alone, cloud IAM, Zanzibar systems (SpiceDB, Ory Keto) - Topaz chosen for best balance
- Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) inspired by Google Zanzibar
- Sidecar deployment pattern for &lt;5ms P99 local authorization checks
- Complete integration examples: Rust proxy middleware, Python CLI, FastAPI admin UI
- Directory schema modeling users, groups, namespaces, backends with relationships
- Three example policies: namespace isolation, time-based maintenance windows, PII protection
- Performance: P50 &lt;0.5ms, P95 &lt;2ms, P99 &lt;5ms for local sidecar checks
- 10,000+ authorization checks per second capacity
- Docker Compose for local dev, Kubernetes sidecar for production
- Fail-closed by default with opt-in fail-open per namespace

**Key Innovation**: Local sidecar authorization combines OPA's policy expressiveness with Zanzibar-style relationship modeling. Real-time policy updates without proxy restarts. Centralized policy management (Git) with decentralized enforcement (local sidecars).

**Impact**: Enables multi-tenancy isolation, role-based access control, attribute-based policies, and resource-level permissions with production-ready performance. Foundation for defense-in-depth security across proxy and plugin layers.

---

#### RFC-019: Plugin SDK Authorization Layer (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-019](/rfc/rfc-019)

**Summary**: Standardized authorization layer in Prism core plugin SDK enabling backend plugins to validate tokens and enforce policies:
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Authorization enforced at proxy AND plugin layers
- Three core components: TokenValidator (JWT/OIDC), TopazClient (policy queries), AuditLogger (structured logging)
- Complete Go SDK implementation with Authorizer interface orchestrating all components
- gRPC interceptors for automatic authorization on all plugin methods
- Token validation with JWKS caching (&lt;1ms with caching)
- Topaz policy checks with 5s decision caching (&lt;1ms P99 cache hit)
- Async audit logging with buffered events (&lt;0.1ms overhead)
- Fail-closed by default with configurable fail-open for local testing
- Configuration examples: production (token + policy enabled) vs local dev (disabled with audit)
- Plugin integration patterns: automatic (gRPC interceptor) vs manual (fine-grained control)

**Key Innovation**: Backend plugins validate authorization independently of proxy, creating defense-in-depth security. SDK provides reusable authorization primitives so plugins just call SDK (no reimplementation). Authorization overhead &lt;3ms P99 with caching enabled.

**Impact**: Eliminates plugin-level security vulnerabilities. Prevents bypassing proxy authorization by connecting directly to plugins. Consistent policy enforcement across all backends. Complete audit trail of data access at plugin layer. Enables zero-trust architecture.

#### MEMO-006: Backend Interface Decomposition and Schema Registry (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-006](/memos/memo-006)

**Summary**: Comprehensive architectural guide for decomposing backends into thin, composable proto service interfaces and establishing schema registry for patterns and slots:
- **Design Decision**: Use explicit interface flavors (not capability flags) for type safety
- 45 thin interfaces across 10 data models (KeyValue, PubSub, Stream, Queue, List, Set, SortedSet, TimeSeries, Graph, Document)
- Each data model has multiple interfaces: Basic (required), Scan, TTL, Transactional, Batch, etc.
- Backend implementation matrix showing interface composition (Redis: 16 interfaces, Postgres: 16 different mix, MemStore: 2 minimal)
- Pattern schemas with slots requiring specific interface combinations
- Schema registry filesystem layout (registry/interfaces/, registry/backends/, registry/patterns/)
- Configuration generator workflow with validation
- Examples: Redis implements keyvalue_basic + keyvalue_scan + keyvalue_ttl + keyvalue_transactional + keyvalue_batch
- Capabilities expressed through interface presence (TTL support = implements keyvalue_ttl interface)

**Key Innovation**: Thin interfaces enable type-safe backend composition. Pattern slots specify required interfaces (e.g., Multicast Registry needs keyvalue_basic + keyvalue_scan for registry slot). No runtime capability checks - compiler enforces contracts.

**Impact**: Enables straightforward config generation, backend substitutability, and clear contracts for what each backend supports. Foundation for schema-driven pattern composition.

#### MEMO-005: Client Protocol Design Philosophy - Composition vs Use-Case Specificity (NEW)
**Link**: [MEMO-005](/memos/memo-005)

**Summary**: Comprehensive memo resolving the architectural tension between composable primitives (RFC-014) and use-case-specific protocols (RFC-017), covering:
- Context comparison: RFC-014 composable primitives vs RFC-017 use-case patterns
- Four design principles (push complexity down, developer comprehension, schema evolution, keep proxy small)
- Proposed layered API architecture: Layer 1 (generic primitives) + Layer 2 (use-case patterns)
- Pattern coordinators as plugins (not core proxy) for independent evolution
- Configuration examples showing per-namespace choice of primitives vs patterns
- Decision matrix comparing primitives-only, patterns-only, and layered approaches
- Implementation roadmap aligned with RFC-018 POCs
- Success metrics for developer experience, system complexity, and pattern adoption

**Key Innovation**: Applications choose per-namespace between Layer 1 (generic KeyValue, PubSub) for maximum control or Layer 2 (ergonomic Multicast Registry, Saga) for rapid development. Pattern coordinators are optional plugins that compose Layer 1 primitives, keeping core proxy small (~10k LOC) while providing self-documenting APIs for common use cases.

**Impact**: Resolves "composition vs use-case" design question with both layers, addressing developer simplicity (Layer 2), proxy size (plugins), and flexibility (Layer 1).
