There can sometimes exist hidden relationships in this data that can be used to build better products and create more meaningful user experiences.

Data warehouses, for example, excel at handling large volumes of data but they lack in things like speed. Other systems like non-relational databases can handle large volumes of data for faster access (at least compared to relational databases).
