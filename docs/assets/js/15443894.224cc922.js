This highlights the platform\'s versatility, allowing for different data access patterns beyond the two most commonly cited examples.","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-data-evolve-migration":{"id":"netflix-data-evolve-migration","title":"Schema Evolution & Data Migrations","description":"Netflix\'s Data Gateway and the broader data platform handle schema evolution and data migrations by embracing abstraction, automation, and a schema-first, federated approach. The core principle is to manage these complex processes at the platform level, isolating application developers from the underlying database mechanics and changes.","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-dual-write-migration":{"id":"netflix-dual-write-migration","title":"Dual-Write Migration Pattern","description":"An excellent example of the dual-write pattern is Netflix\'s migration of its invoicing data from a legacy MySQL database to a new Apache Cassandra instance. The Data Gateway played a central role in abstracting this process from the application services, allowing for a seamless, low-downtime transition.","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-index":{"id":"netflix-index","title":"Netflix Data Gateway Reference","description":"This section contains research and learnings from Netflix\'s Data Gateway architecture, which serves as inspiration for the Prism data access layer.","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-key-use-cases":{"id":"netflix-key-use-cases","title":"Netflix Data Gateway Use Cases","description":"That\'s a very insightful observation, and it\'s mostly correct, but with an important distinction: Key-Value (KV) is the most prominent and mature abstraction built on the Data Gateway platform, but it is not the only one. The Data Gateway is a broader platform that enables the creation of various data abstraction layers to serve different use cases.","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-scale":{"id":"netflix-scale","title":"Netflix Data Gateway Scale Metrics","description":"Netflix\'s Data Gateway approach has enabled the company to achieve massive scale across a number of dimensions, supporting a global user base and billions of requests daily. It is a critical component of Netflix\'s microservice infrastructure, providing abstractions that manage the complexity and performance of multiple data stores.","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-summary":{"id":"netflix-summary","title":"Netflix Data Gateway: Key Lessons","description":"Netflix\'s experience with its data access layer offers several key lessons, particularly in managing the scale and complexity of a global streaming service:","sidebar":"netflixSidebar"},"netflix-video1":{"id":"netflix-video1","title":"Data Abstractions at Scale (Video Transcript)","description":"This is a raw transcript from a conference talk.
