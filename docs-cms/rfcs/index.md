# Request for Comments (RFCs)

RFCs are detailed technical specifications for major features and architectural components in Prism. Each RFC provides comprehensive design documentation, implementation guidelines, and rationale for significant system changes.

## Purpose

RFCs serve to:
- Define complete technical specifications before implementation
- Enable thorough review and feedback from stakeholders
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide implementation roadmaps for complex features

## RFC Process

1. **Draft**: Initial specification written by author(s)
2. **Review**: Team discussion and feedback period
3. **Proposed**: Refined specification ready for approval
4. **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
5. **Implemented**: Feature completed and deployed

## Active RFCs

### RFC-001: Prism Data Access Layer Architecture

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Complete architecture for Prism, defining the high-performance data access gateway with unified interface, dynamic configuration, and backend abstraction.

### RFC-002: Data Layer Interface Specification

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Specifies the complete data layer interface including gRPC services, message formats, error handling, and client patterns for five core abstractions: Sessions, Queues, PubSub, Readers, and Transactions.

### RFC-003: Admin Interface for Prism

**Status**: Proposed
**Summary**: Administrative interface specification enabling operators to manage configurations, monitor sessions, view backend health, and perform operational tasks with both gRPC API and browser-based UI.

## Writing RFCs

RFCs should include:
- **Abstract**: One-paragraph summary
- **Motivation**: Why this change is needed
- **Detailed Design**: Complete technical specification
- **Implementation Plan**: Phases and milestones
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches and trade-offs
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues for discussion
