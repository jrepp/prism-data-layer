# Request for Comments (RFCs)

RFCs are detailed technical specifications for major features and architectural components in Prism. Each RFC provides comprehensive design documentation, implementation guidelines, and rationale for significant system changes.

## Purpose

RFCs serve to:
- Define complete technical specifications before implementation
- Enable thorough review and feedback from stakeholders
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide implementation roadmaps for complex features

## RFC Process

1. **Draft**: Initial specification written by author(s)
2. **Review**: Team discussion and feedback period
3. **Proposed**: Refined specification ready for approval
4. **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
5. **Implemented**: Feature completed and deployed

## Active RFCs

### RFC-001: Prism Data Access Layer Architecture

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Complete architecture for Prism, defining the high-performance data access gateway with unified interface, dynamic configuration, and backend abstraction.

### RFC-002: Data Layer Interface Specification

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Specifies the complete data layer interface including gRPC services, message formats, error handling, and client patterns for five core abstractions: Sessions, Queues, PubSub, Readers, and Transactions.

### RFC-004: Redis Integration

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Comprehensive Redis integration covering three distinct access patterns: Cache (HashMap operations), PubSub (broadcasting), and Vector Similarity Search for ML embeddings and semantic search.

[Read RFC-004 →](./RFC-004-redis-integration)

---

### RFC-005: ClickHouse Integration for Time Series

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: ClickHouse-backed time series analytics for OLAP workloads, supporting 1M+ events/sec ingestion with ReplicatedMergeTree engine, materialized views for pre-aggregations, and tiered storage with TTL.

[Read RFC-005 →](./RFC-005-clickhouse-integration)

---

### RFC-006: Python Admin CLI

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Python-based command-line interface for administering Prism, covering namespace management, backend health checks, session inspection, metrics, and shadow traffic management using Typer and Rich for excellent developer experience.

[Read RFC-006 →](/rfc/rfc-006)

---

### RFC-007: Cache Strategies for Data Layer

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Standardized cache strategies including look-aside (cache-aside) and write-through patterns for common use cases like table readers and object storage metadata, with configuration-driven behavior and observability.

[Read RFC-007 →](/rfc/rfc-007)

---

### RFC-008: Proxy Plugin Architecture

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Architectural separation between minimal proxy core (networking, auth, config) and backend plugins (data-source-specific logic), enabling extensibility through in-process, sidecar, and remote plugin deployment models with secure channels.

[Read RFC-008 →](/rfc/rfc-008)

---

### RFC-009: Distributed Reliability Data Patterns

**Status**: Proposed
**Summary**: High-level distributed reliability patterns that push complexity into the data access layer: Tiered Storage, Write-Ahead Log, Claim Check, Event Sourcing, Change Data Capture, CQRS, and Outbox patterns for building scalable, fault-tolerant systems.

---

### RFC-010: Test-Driven Development for Patterns

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: TDD workflow for backend patterns with mandatory code coverage thresholds (85%+ for patterns, 90%+ for utilities), Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforcement, and CI/CD integration for quality gates.

---

### RFC-011: Prism Loadtest Infrastructure

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Load testing infrastructure using Python asyncio for realistic traffic generation, supporting configurable RPS, latency measurement, and backend stress testing with comprehensive metrics collection.

[Read RFC-011 →](/rfc/rfc-011)

---

### RFC-012: Structured Error Handling

**Status**: Proposed
**Summary**: Comprehensive error handling strategy with status codes, retryability signals, detailed error context, and client-friendly error messages, using protobuf for wire format and builder pattern for ergonomics.

[Read RFC-012 →](/rfc/rfc-012)

---

### RFC-013: Pattern Capability Interfaces

**Status**: Draft
**Summary**: Fine-grained capability interfaces replacing monolithic backend interfaces, enabling backends to implement only supported operations (KeyValueBasic, KeyValueTTL, KeyValueScan, KeyValueAtomic) with schema-driven validation.

[Read RFC-013 →](/rfc/rfc-013)

---

### RFC-014: Layered Data Access Patterns

**Status**: Proposed
**Summary**: Three-layer pattern architecture (Basic, Advanced, Specialized) allowing applications to declare requirements at appropriate abstraction level, with automatic backend selection based on capability matching.

[Read RFC-014 →](/rfc/rfc-014)

---

### RFC-015: Plugin Acceptance Test Framework

**Status**: Accepted
**Summary**: World-class acceptance testing framework enabling ~50 lines of backend integration code to automatically receive comprehensive test coverage across all supported patterns, with capability-based filtering and matrix reports.

---

### RFC-016: Local Development Infrastructure

**Status**: Proposed
**Summary**: Complete local development infrastructure including Signoz (observability), Dex (OIDC identity), auto-provisioned developer identity, independent Docker Compose stacks, and lifecycle management with version tracking.
