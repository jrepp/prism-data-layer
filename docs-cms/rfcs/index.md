# Request for Comments (RFCs)

RFCs are detailed technical specifications for major features and architectural components in Prism. Each RFC provides comprehensive design documentation, implementation guidelines, and rationale for significant system changes.

## üéØ New to Prism? Start Here

If you're new to Prism, we recommend this reading path:
