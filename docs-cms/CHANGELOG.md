# Documentation Change Log

Quick access to recently updated documentation. Changes listed in reverse chronological order (newest first).

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-09

#### RFC-014: Layered Data Access Patterns (NEW)
**Link**: [RFC-014](/rfc/RFC-014-layered-data-access-patterns)

**Summary**: New RFC defining how Prism separates client API from backend implementation through pattern composition. Covers:
- Three-layer architecture (Client API, Pattern Composition, Backend Execution)
- Publisher with Claim Check pattern implementation
- Pattern layering and compatibility matrix
- Proxy internal structure with mermaid diagrams
- Authentication and authorization flow diagrams
- Pattern routing and execution strategies

**Impact**: Provides foundation for composable reliability patterns without client code changes.

#### RFC-011: Data Proxy Authentication - Open Questions Expanded
**Link**: [RFC-011](/rfc/RFC-011-data-proxy-authentication)

**Summary**: Added comprehensive feedback to open questions:
- Certificate Authority: Use Vault for certificate management
- Credential Caching: 24-hour default, configurable with refresh tokens
- Connection Pooling: Per-credential pooling for multi-tenancy isolation
- Fallback Auth: Fail closed with configurable grace period
- Observability: Detailed metrics for credential events and session establishment

**Impact**: Clarifies authentication implementation decisions with practical recommendations.

---

#### RFC-010: Admin Protocol with OIDC - Multi-Provider Support
**Link**: [RFC-010](/rfc/RFC-010-admin-protocol-oidc)

**Summary**: Expanded open questions with detailed answers:
- OIDC Provider Support: AWS Cognito, Azure AD, Google, Okta, Auth0, Dex
- Token Caching: 24-hour default with JWKS caching and refresh token support
- Offline Access: JWT validation with cached JWKS, security trade-offs
- Multi-Tenancy: Four mapping options (group-based, claim-based, OPA policy, tenant-scoped)
- Service Accounts: Four approaches with comparison table and best practices

**Impact**: Production-ready guidance for OIDC integration across multiple identity providers.

---

#### RFC-009: Distributed Reliability Patterns - Change Notification Graph
**Link**: [RFC-009](/rfc/RFC-009-distributed-reliability-patterns)

**Summary**: Added change notification flow diagram to CDC pattern showing:
- Change type classification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SCHEMA)
- Notification consumers (Cache Invalidator, Search Indexer, Analytics Loader, Webhook Notifier, Audit Logger)
- Data flow from PostgreSQL WAL through Kafka to downstream systems
- Key notification patterns and use cases

**Impact**: Visual guide for implementing CDC-based change notification architectures.

## Older Changes

### 2025-10-08

#### RFC-009: Distributed Reliability Patterns (INITIAL)
**Link**: [RFC-009](/rfc/RFC-009-distributed-reliability-patterns)

**Summary**: Initial RFC documenting 7 distributed reliability patterns:
1. Tiered Storage - Hot/warm/cold data lifecycle
2. Write-Ahead Log - Durable, fast writes
3. Claim Check - Large payload handling in messaging
4. Event Sourcing - Immutable event log as source of truth
5. Change Data Capture - Database replication without dual writes
6. CQRS - Separate read/write models
7. Outbox - Transactional messaging

**Impact**: Establishes pattern catalog for building reliable distributed systems.

---

### 2025-10-07

#### RFC-001: Prism Architecture (INITIAL)
**Link**: [RFC-001](/rfc/RFC-001-prism-architecture)

**Summary**: Foundational architecture RFC defining:
- System components and layered interface hierarchy
- Client configuration system (server vs client config)
- Session management lifecycle
- Five interface layers (Queue, PubSub, Reader, Transact, Config)
- Container plugin model for backend-specific logic
- Performance targets (P99 &lt;10ms, 10k+ RPS)

**Impact**: Core architectural vision for Prism data access gateway.

---

#### RFC-002: Data Layer Interface Specification (INITIAL)
**Link**: [RFC-002](/rfc/RFC-002-data-layer-interface)

**Summary**: Complete gRPC interface specification covering:
- Session Service (authentication, heartbeat, lifecycle)
- Queue Service (Kafka-style operations)
- PubSub Service (NATS-style wildcards)
- Reader Service (database-style paged reading)
- Transact Service (two-table transactional writes)
- Error handling and backward compatibility

**Impact**: Stable, versioned API contracts for all client interactions.
