# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

Product Requirements Documents define the product vision, features, user stories, and success criteria for Prism components.

## Available PRDs

- [PRD-001: Prism Data Access Gateway](/prds/prd-001) - Core product vision and requirements

## What is a PRD?

PRDs serve as the source of truth for:
- **Product Vision**: What problem are we solving and why?
- **Target Users**: Who will use this feature?
- **User Stories**: Specific scenarios and use cases
- **Success Metrics**: How do we measure success?
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Out of Scope**: What we're explicitly not building

## PRD Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial product concept and problem statement
2. **Review**: Team feedback and iteration
3. **Approved**: Ready for implementation planning
4. **Implemented**: Feature complete and deployed
5. **Archived**: Superseded or no longer relevant

## Relationship to Other Documents

- **ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records) document technical decisions made while implementing PRDs
- **RFCs** (Request for Comments) propose technical designs to satisfy PRD requirements
- **MEMOs** provide technical analysis and deep dives on specific topics
