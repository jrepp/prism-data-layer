# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section documents all significant architectural decisions made in the Prism Data Access Layer project. Each ADR captures the context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences of a specific architectural choice.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- **Understand** why certain decisions were made
- **Evaluate** alternatives that were considered
- **Learn** from past decisions
- **Onboard** new team members to the project's architectural philosophy

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

1. **Context**: The problem or situation that requires a decision
2. **Decision**: The architectural choice that was made
3. **Rationale**: Why this decision was made (alternatives considered)
4. **Consequences**: Impact of the decision (positive, negative, neutral)

## ADR Status

ADRs can have the following statuses:

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision made and documented
- **Implemented**: Decision implemented in code
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Contributing

When making a significant architectural decision:

1. Create a new ADR using the template: `ADR-000-template.md`
2. Number it sequentially (next available number)
3. Fill in all sections with context and rationale
4. Submit for review with the core team
5. Update status as the decision progresses
