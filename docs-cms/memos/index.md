## Key Memos

### Implementation Guides

#### MEMO-004: Backend Plugin Implementation Guide
**Summary**: Comprehensive rubric comparing 8 backends (MemStore, Redis, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Kafka, NATS, S3/MinIO, ClickHouse) ranked by implementability, with Go SDK quality assessment, data models, testing difficulty, and demo plugin configurations.

#### MEMO-014: Pattern SDK Shared Complexity
**Summary**: Analysis of shared complexity in pattern SDK (config parsing, health checks, lifecycle, error handling), refactoring strategy to eliminate boilerplate, and examples showing before/after code reduction from 200+ lines to ~50 lines per pattern.
