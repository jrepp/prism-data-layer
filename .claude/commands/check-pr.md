# Check and Fix Pull Request

You are tasked with checking an existing pull request and fixing any quality issues.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Current PR

```bash
# Get current branch
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Find PR for current branch
gh pr view --json number,title,body,url
```

If no PR found for current branch:
- Stop and inform user
- Suggest they create PR first with `/submit-pr`

### 2. Analyze PR Quality

Check PR against standards from `.claude/commands/submit-pr.md`:

**Title Issues**:
- [ ] Over 72 characters
- [ ] Contains emojis
- [ ] Uses wrong verb tense (not imperative)
- [ ] Too vague or generic
- [ ] Contains marketing language
- [ ] Has trailing period

**Body Issues**:
- [ ] Missing or poor structure
- [ ] Contains emojis (except appropriate checklist items)
- [ ] Uses marketing language (amazing, awesome, incredible, etc.)
- [ ] Lacks specific file references
- [ ] No quantified improvements
- [ ] Missing testing checklist
- [ ] No breaking changes section
- [ ] No dependencies section
- [ ] Uses paragraphs instead of bullet points
- [ ] Excessive enthusiasm or fluff

**Content Issues**:
- [ ] Vague descriptions without technical details
- [ ] Missing "User request:" attribution
- [ ] No measurable impacts where relevant
- [ ] Poor categorization of changes

### 3. Extract Technical Information

To rewrite PR properly, analyze:

```bash
# Get all commits in PR
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# Get detailed commit messages
git log main..HEAD --format="%H%n%s%n%b%n---"

# Get file changes
git diff main..HEAD --stat

# Get specific changes per file
git diff main..HEAD --name-only | head -10
```

Extract:
- Technical changes made (what files, what functionality)
- Measurable improvements (time, performance, coverage)
- Breaking changes or new dependencies
- Testing implications

### 4. Generate Fixed Title

Apply rules:
- Choose correct action verb (Add/Fix/Update/Refactor/Optimize/Remove/Document)
- Maximum 72 characters
- Imperative mood
- Technical and specific
- No emojis, no marketing language
- No trailing period

**Decision tree for action verb**:
- New functionality ‚Üí `Add`
- Bug fix ‚Üí `Fix`
- Enhance existing ‚Üí `Update`
- Code restructure ‚Üí `Refactor`
- Performance ‚Üí `Optimize`
- Delete code ‚Üí `Remove`
- Docs only ‚Üí `Document`

### 5. Generate Fixed Body

Follow exact structure:

```markdown
## Summary

- First technical change with specific impact
- Second technical change with file reference
- Third technical change with measurable outcome

## Changes

### New Features
- Feature 1 in `path/to/file.ext:123`
- Feature 2 with quantified benefit

### Bug Fixes
- Fix 1 resolving specific issue
- Fix 2 in `path/to/file.ext:456`

### Improvements
- Improvement 1 (reduces X by Y%)
- Improvement 2 enabling new capability

### Documentation
- Doc change 1
- Doc change 2

## Technical Details

<Optional: Include if architectural decisions, trade-offs, or implementation notes are relevant>

Example:
- Implements merge queue using GitHub Actions merge_group event
- Mirrors CI pipeline but optimizes by removing coverage uploads
- Uses concurrency groups to prevent duplicate runs

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests pass locally
- [ ] Integration tests pass locally
- [ ] CI pipeline passes
- [ ] Manual testing completed for affected features
- [ ] <Any pattern-specific testing>

## Breaking Changes

None

OR

- Breaking change 1 with migration path
- Breaking change 2 with workaround

## Dependencies

None

OR

- New dependency: package-name@version (reason)
- Updated dependency: package-name from X to Y (reason)

---
User request: "<original user request if available>"
```

**Rules to enforce**:
- Use bullet points, never paragraphs
- Include file paths with line numbers where relevant
- Quantify all improvements (time, percentage, count)
- Remove ALL emojis from body
- Remove marketing language
- Be concise and factual
- Categorize changes logically
- Include specific examples, not generalizations

### 6. Apply Fixes

If issues found:

```bash
# Update PR title and body
gh pr edit <number> --title "<fixed-title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<fixed-body>
EOF
)"

# Add explanatory comment
gh pr comment <number> --body "Updated PR description to meet quality standards:
- Fixed title format (imperative mood, under 72 chars)
- Restructured body with bullet points
- Removed marketing language and emojis
- Added quantified improvements
- Included file references and testing checklist"
```

### 7. Check for Local Changes Needed

If PR quality issues suggest code problems:
- Typos in commit messages ‚Üí Offer to amend (if safe)
- Missing files ‚Üí Ask user if should be included
- Unclear changes ‚Üí Request clarification before updating

**DO NOT**:
- Rewrite git history without permission
- Force push to remote
- Amend commits from other authors
- Make code changes without user confirmation

### 8. Validation

After updating, verify:

```bash
# Re-fetch PR to confirm changes
gh pr view <number> --json title,body

# Validate title length
echo "<title>" | wc -c

# Check for emoji in title/body
echo "<title>" | grep -E "[üöÄ‚ú®üéâüí°üîßüêõ]" && echo "‚ùå Emojis found" || echo "‚úÖ No emojis"
```

### 9. Output to User

Report findings in this format:

```
PR #<number>: <url>

Issues Found:
- Title: <issue description>
- Body: <issue description>
- Content: <issue description>

Fixes Applied:
- Updated title from "<old>" to "<new>"
- Restructured body with proper sections
- Added <X> file references
- Quantified <Y> improvements
- Removed <Z> instances of marketing language

New Title: <fixed-title>

Validation:
- Title length: <X>/72 characters
- Emojis removed: Yes
- Structure: Complete
- File references: <count>
- Testing checklist: Included
```

## Special Cases

### If PR is Already High Quality

```
PR #<number>: <url>

Status: ‚úì Meets quality standards

Title: "<title>" (<X>/72 characters)
- Proper action verb
- Imperative mood
- Technical and specific

Body:
- Well-structured with sections
- Uses bullet points
- Includes file references
- Quantifies improvements
- No marketing language
- Complete testing checklist

No changes needed.
```

### If PR Has Minor Issues

Only update if improvements are substantial. For minor issues:
- Note them in output
- Ask user if they want to update
- Apply fixes only if user confirms

### If Unable to Extract Technical Details

```
Unable to determine technical details for PR rewrite.

Please provide:
- What problem does this PR solve?
- What are the key technical changes?
- Are there measurable improvements?
- Are there breaking changes?

Or run `/submit-pr` to create fresh PR with proper analysis.
```

## Examples

### Bad Title ‚Üí Fixed
- ‚ùå "Update workflows and add merge queue stuff üöÄ"
- ‚úÖ "Add merge queue support for GitHub Actions"

- ‚ùå "Fixed the broken patterns that weren't working"
- ‚úÖ "Fix pattern build dependencies in CI workflow"

- ‚ùå "Amazing optimization making everything super fast!!!"
- ‚úÖ "Optimize Go module caching in test pipeline"

### Bad Body ‚Üí Fixed

‚ùå **Before**:
```
This PR adds some really cool merge queue features! üéâ

We updated the workflows to support merge queues which is awesome because it will help prevent broken builds on main. Also fixed some other stuff.

Everything is working great now! ‚ú®
```

‚úÖ **After**:
```
## Summary

- Add merge queue workflow triggering on merge_group events
- Update CI workflows (ci.yml, pattern-acceptance-tests.yml, lint-workflows.yml)
- Fix pattern build by adding go mod download step

## Changes

### New Workflows
- Add `.github/workflows/merge-queue.yml` with comprehensive CI checks
- Add `.github/MERGE_QUEUE_SETUP.md` with configuration guide

### CI Updates
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml:22` to trigger on merge_group
- Update `.github/workflows/pattern-acceptance-tests.yml:26` to trigger on merge_group
- Update `.github/workflows/lint-workflows.yml:12` to trigger on merge_group
- Modify concurrency groups to handle merge_group.head_sha

### Bug Fixes
- Add dependency download step in `.github/workflows/pattern-acceptance-tests.yml:120`
- Fixes missing go.sum entries causing build failures

## Technical Details

Implements GitHub merge queue support per GitHub Actions documentation. When PRs enter the merge queue, a temporary merge commit is created and all CI workflows run. This prevents integration issues between concurrent PRs.

## Testing

- [x] CI pipeline passes on PR branch
- [x] Merge queue workflow validates successfully
- [ ] Test with actual merge queue (requires admin configuration)

## Breaking Changes

None

## Dependencies

None
```

## Error Handling

If any command fails:
- Report exact error to user
- Suggest resolution
- Do not proceed with updates if validation fails
- Ask user for manual intervention if needed

## Commit Strategy

If making changes beyond PR description:
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Follow repository commit format (see `.claude/commands/commit-format.md`)
- Stage only intended files
- Push to same branch

Do not create commits for PR description updates only.
